							<h1>Welcome to Zendikar</h1>
							<p class="major">Trap-riddled ruins can be found on every continent. Mysterious glyphs hint at truths long forgotten. Unspeakable monsters lurk in the quiet of these hidden monuments of a forgotten past. The ruins still emanate power, and both planeswalkers and local explorers alike will undergo great peril to reap their rewards. From the otherworldly hedrons that drift across the sky, to the wondrous power of Life Blooms, Zendikar has no shortage of adventure and mysteries. While the Roil prevents civilization from grabbing hold, the spirit of the people of Zendikar knows no bounds as they continue to dredge into the earth, searching for ancient secrets perhaps better left undiscovered.</p>

				<!-- History Overview -->
					<section class="wrapper style1 align-center" id="first">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>A Forgotten History</h2>
							<p>Zendikar’s history is long, but mostly undocumented. Due to the extreme destructive powers of the Roil and numerous cataclysmic events in the past, very few civilizations survived long enough to leave a mark on history, with none of those civilizations still intact today. However, from the stories passed down by the people of Zendikar, history is broken up into roughly three ages. The first age had magnificent cities and technology, the ruins of which can still be found scattered across the plane. The second age saw the construction of the mysterious hedrons and Skyclaves, as well as the dominance of the Makindi Empire - from which the Kor are descended. And the third age is today - the time of the Roil. A time where any amount of civilization can be destroyed in an instant by natural phenomenon, where people explore ancient ruins in search of treasure and power, where the lands of Zendikar seem to be truly <em>alive</em>.</p>

							<h2>Hedrons</h2>
							<p>Large, floating polyhedron-shaped stones called hedrons litter the landscape and sky. No one knows for sure what they are, but their gravity-defying existence hints at the strange properties of all gravity and mana on the plane. These ancient, rune-carved monoliths are strewn across Zendikar. Up to ten miles long, some of these stones drift in the sky; others are buried in the ground, some whole, some broken.</p>

				<!-- The Roil -->
					<section class="wrapper style1 align-center">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>The Roil</h2>
							<p>The Roil is the colloquial name for Zendikar’s periodic volatility of the earth and climate. This force changes the land and is the reason why the plane remains untamed and deadly. Because it is magical in nature, the Roil can affect biology as well as geology and meteorology. Some of the effects of the Roil are as follows:</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>

									<p>Sudden and meteoric eruptions of growth in both plant and animal life across a small region, as if Zendikar is trying to repair itself after the damage it caused.</p>

							<h2>The Skyclaves</h2>
							<p>Most continents possess a Skyclave, a collapsed ruin of a once floating city, seemingly from the same age as the hedrons. Whatever magic once held them aloft is no longer - except for the Skyclave in Akoum which floats still. However, due to the floating rubble and hedrons surrounding it, the height at which it floats in the sky, and the nest of drakes and dragons which call it home, it remains mostly unexplored.</p>

				<!-- Life Overview -->
					<section class="wrapper style1 align-center">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Societies Driven By Exploration</h2>
							<p>Thanks to the Roil and the cataclysms that brought all former civilizations on Zendikar to their abrupt end, Zendikar is a tapestry of ever-changing geography and hidden mysteries. Because of this, exploring unknown territory and searching for lost technologies are crucial to the Zendikari way of life. Most organized efforts of exploration on Zendikar originate from the few centers of civilization, particularly Sea Gate.</p>
							<p>Academic institutions task explorers to draw accurate maps (which must be updated frequently), collect ancient artifacts for study, and obtain general knowledge of the world beyond the city walls. Wealthy merchants also invest in expeditions, hoping to multiply their wealth and power with the discovery of valuable natural resources, the estab- lishment of new trade routes, and the acquisition of items that can be sold to academic institutions. Successful explorers often use the proceeds of their first expeditions to fund later ones, cherishing the freedom that comes from serving no master but the call of discovery. Though humans often form the backbones of these expeditions, they typically incorporate adventurers of other races as well, drawing on the broad expertise of Zendikar's diverse peoples. Trail guides, porters, mountaineering experts, diviners, hunters, trappers, cartographers, mages, missionaries, scholars, mercenaries, smiths, healers, and beasts of burden can turn an expedition into a large caravan that's practically a self-contained community.</p>
							<p>In Sea Gate, six so-called expeditionary houses launch regular excursions into the wilds for various purposes. Named for the destinations of their first expeditions, they are the Valakut House, the Pelakka Foundation, and the Akoum, Murasa, Tazeem, and Bala Ged Expeditionary Houses. The rivalries of the houses are legendary, and they sometimes sabotage each other's expeditions - but sometimes they will work together on truly unique contracts. Each maintains hostels in various settlements, which serve as resources for adventurers and explorers who need to hire guides or purchase supplies.</p>
