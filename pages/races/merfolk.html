							<h1>Merfolk of Zendikar</h1>
							<p>"Some merfolk choose to rest their fins in the water. I believe wisdom exists not only where we were born but where we were told not to go.” 
								~ Henn Aran, galecaller

						</header>
						<p class="major">Curious, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. Merfolk society is organized around their belief in three deities. Ula, the god of the sea, Emeria, the goddess of the wind, and Cosi, the Trickster. A merfolk isn’t born into a creed, but rather chooses it upon reaching adulthood, and it is rare for a merfolk not to choose a creed. Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren’t hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret.  Merfolk are associated with blue mana, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.</p>

						<h2>Merfolk Appearance</h2>
						<p>Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones. Merfolk wear little clothing unless they are armored for battle. Even then, they drape themselves with nets and a minimum of cloth, wearing armor crafted of large, bleached seashells and augmented with leather.</p>

						<h2>Merfolk Religion</h2>
						<p>Merfolk beliefs divide the world into three realms of sky, sea, and land, each presided over by one deity. Each individual merfolk typically chooses to follow the creed of one god or another, shaping his or her life around the teachings and ideals of that deity.</p>

						<h2>Noyan Dar</h2>
						<p>The lullmage Noyan Dar, formerly an iconoclastic scholar at the Sea Gate lighthouse, has taken on the mantle of leadership for the merfolk of Tazeem. He has moved inland to Coralhelm, which has become a capital for merfolk from across the plane under his rule. Noyan Dar's studies has led him to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the plane itself and the Roil that rages across it, but his research has been dismissed by the Ula-creed merfolk, who reject his intuitive leaps. He now guides the explorers and scholars among the merfolk that reside in Coralhelm by forming alliances with other settlements and expedition teams - coordinating their efforts to understand the ancient ruins, the power of the hedrons, and the history of Zendikar and the Roil that plagues it. Coralhelm is thus also a central repository for the results of these studies.</p>

						<h2>Search for Knowledge</h2>
						<p>The brave merfolk who set out on expeditions and bring the information back to Coralhelm have a short life expectancy. But these merfolk are united in the belief that they will find answers through observation and study. The merfolk who volunteer for this task are both intelligent and resilient, and they are increasingly joined by members of other races. Elite merfolk soldiers called seastalkers are allocated from Coralhelm to protect expeditions that are believed to have a good chance of yielding valuable information. Occasionally, one or more seastalkers are assigned to accompany an expedition even against its leader's will to ensure that any knowledge gained on the expedition is put to proper use.</p>

						<h2>Natural Historians</h2>
						<p>As a race, the merfolk place great value on scholarship and history. They consider writing to be the highest form of artistic expression, and the art of historical writing specifically - creating chronicles - is highly valued in merfolk society. Merfolk of different creeds have taken different approaches to their chronicles, but the heart of the practice was and remains consistent: analyzing current events in the context of history and making careful records that synthesize observations into a coherent narrative.
							The sophisticated written language of the merfolk combines alphabetic script with pictographic symbols holding complicated layers of meaning. Merfolk record their chronicles on scrolls made from the tanned hides of gladeheart gazelles, embossing the script with specialized styluses.

						<h2>Emeria Creed</h2>
						<p>The goddess Emeria rules the Wind Realm, including the sky, the wind, and the clouds. She is seen as a goddess of magic and mysticism and is represented as an angel with dark hair and silver eyes. Those merfolk who follow her creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring mystical forces rather than natural causes behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others and are often described as manipulative and deceptive. Part of the philosophy associated with blue mana is that a person's or thing's essence is as malleable as its surface appearance, so from that perspective this behavior was not deceptive as such, but reflected the shifting and subjective nature of reality. Wizards of the Emeria creed focused their use of blue mana on spells of control, particularly magic of calming the land, its creatures, other people, or even magic itself. Practitioners of this magic, called lullmages, were highly sought after by explorers but rarely trusted because of their tendency toward manipulative scheming.</p>
						<p><b>Wind Creed.</b>  You have proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
							<br><b>Cantrip.</b> You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Ula Creed</h2>
						<p>The god Ula is said to rule the Water Realm, including the seas, rivers, and lakes. He is a god of practical knowledge and exploration and is depicted as a merfolk with the tail of a fish in place of legs. Ula-creed merfolk emphasized the intellectual aspects of blue-aligned philosophy, stressing hard evidence and reason over passion. They are analytical scholars, chroniclers, explorers, and navigators who pride themselves on being blunt and straightforward. Ula-creed "stonereaders" seek out and studied ancient ruins in an effort to reconstruct a historical record of Zendikar.</p>
						<p><b>Water Creed Manipulation.</b> You have proficiency with navigator’s tools and in the Survival skill.

						<h2>Cosi Creed</h2>
						<p>The trickster-god Cosi rules everything other than the wind and the sea: the dangerous and inhospitable land of Zendikar, where chaos and misfortune reign supreme. No merfolk would openly admit to following his creed, but the most ambitious and manipulative among them viewed Cosi as an ally who could grant them control over the chaotic forces of the world. Cosi merfolk are known to find themselves as spies and infiltrators, sometimes for hire, and sometimes just to benefit themselves.</p>
						<p><b>Creed of the Trickster.</b> You have proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills. 
							<br><b>Cantrip.</b> You know one cantrip of your choice from the bard spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
