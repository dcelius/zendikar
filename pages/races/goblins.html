							<h1>Goblins of Zendikar</h1>
							<p>"Goblin guides are cheap, but be careful. It's a lot easier to steal from a corpse than a customer." 
								~ Samila, Murasa Expeditionary House

						<p class="major">Goblins are an inquisitive and adaptable race hampered by their small size, their natural cowardice, and a severe shortage of common sense. They eagerly explore areas that others hesitate to enter, and obsessively fiddle with magic that more sensible folk would take careful precautions with. They prize ancient artifacts not for their inherent value, but primarily as a mark of status—for a precious trophy proves that its owner survived a delve into a deep and dangerous ruin. Goblins are associated with red mana. Their shamans are fond of spells that create or control fire and lightning to smite their foes, and they are quick to follow their impulses and passions into action without much forethought. Life to a goblin is an adventure full of new things to explore and experience.</p>

						<h2>Goblin Appearance</h2>
						<p>A typical goblin stands between three-and-a-half and five feet tall, with a slender, elongated build. Goblins’ arms are unusually long and spindly, making them adept at climbing cliffs and trees. Their skin has a stony texture, ranging in color from red-brown to moss green or gray. Their ears are large and swept back, their eyes are intensely red, and many sport heavy bone protrusions on their spines or elbows. Males have similar growths jutting from their chins, while females have heavier growths on their foreheads. This distinctive appearance is a direct result of the goblins’ unusual diet. Goblins supplement their normal diet with a kind of rock they pound into bits and call “grit.” As an added benefit, it toughens their skin, protecting them from the elements and from physical dangers.</p>

						<h2>Authority of the Bold</h2>
						<p>To the goblin mind, the most useful trait in a leader is practical survival knowledge. Goblins measure this knowledge by venturing into ancient ruins to retrieve interesting or powerful objects, and goblins with more impressive artifacts hold greater status in their tribes. Goblins are known to carry their most impressive prizes with them at all times, and a goblin who hasn't yet retrieved an object from a ruin was not considered a full member of the tribe. However, goblins will often accept a commonplace rock, shell, or chunk of metal as an artifact since goblins' fearful nature steers many of them away from any actual ruins. Ambitious goblins, though, strive constantly to outdo each other, delving deeper and deeper in search of the most impressive prizes. Thus, few ambitious goblins live to old age, so most goblin leaders are comparatively young.</p>

						<h2>Tuktuk, the Changed</h2>
						<p>The goblin explorer Tuktuk was remade by strange magic after delving deep into a ruin on Akoum. His living body was destroyed, but some remnant of him was imbued into a stone body that was goblin-like in its general outline. Clinging to fragmented memories of his past life, this duplicate Tuktuk returned to the tribe and was made chief. Though he is unable to speak, it is obvious that he brought something truly amazing back from the ruins, and his physical strength has been amplified fivefold. And so he has led the tribe for fifty years, communicating with his followers by means of a weird psychic network, a result of the magic that created him.</p>

			<!-- Grotag -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="tajuru">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Grotag</h2>
						<p>Smaller and weaker than their cousins, and with larger hands and feet, goblins of the Grotag tribe attempt to live by their wits—not a winning proposition. When a Grotag goblin has the bright idea of trying to tame fleshpiercer mites, at least a few others will be willing to follow that goblin into a nest—usually to predictably horrible results. But though the Grotag seem to have a never-ending supply of bad ideas, and a horrible ratio of bad ideas to good, the Grotag likewise seem to have a never-ending supply of Grotag. As such, by trial and error (and more error), these goblins have stumbled across a great deal of knowledge useful for surviving the deep places of Zendikar, and for dealing with the creatures that live there. The Grotag imagine themselves to have a sort of empathy with beasts, and they lose hundreds of goblins each year to ill-advised attempts at monster taming. But, every now and again, one of these efforts is successful.</p>
						<p><b>Grotag Tamer.</b> You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.</p>

			<!-- Lavastep -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-left onscroll-image-fade-in" id="joraga">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Lavastep</h2>
						<p>The Lavastep tribe is the most industrious of the goblin tribes, and possesses much hard-won knowledge of the geothermal activity in Akoum. More so than members of the other tribes, the Lavastep goblins build surprisingly effective equipment out of the crystal shards and veins of strange metals that occasionally boil up to the surface. They believe that the fires deep beneath the ground are sentient, and their shamans inhale sulfurous fumes in hopes of receiving communications from their fiery deities. Ritual burning and scarification, part of their religious rituals, has left most Lavasteps extremely tolerant of heat and flame and highly desensitized to pain.
							The most warlike of their kind, Lavastep goblins frequently harass the kor, elves, and humans of Akoum.</p>
						<p><b>Lavastep Grit.</b> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>

			<!-- Trogden -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-left onscroll-image-fade-in" id="mul-daya">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Trogden</h2>
						<p>Descended from a group of exiled Lavasteps, the Trogden sought shelter in the deepest parts of Akoum, colonizing the volcanic caves left behind by previous eruptions and deep chasms opened by the Roil. They live as far underground as possible, following strange magical emanations called the "stonesong," which they believe comes from the fire gods of the depths. Perhaps warped by these energies, the subterranean goblins have adapted quickly to the lightless conditions of their new home and have become sightless and pale, with enlarged ears for echolocation.</p>
						<p><b>Keen Hearing.</b> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. 
							<br><b>Echolocation.</b> You have blindsight of 60ft. When you are incapable of making sound or are deafened, you are blinded and cannot use your blindsight. You have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and effects that cause thunder damage.</p>

			<!-- Tuktuk -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="mul-daya">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Tuktuk</h2>
						<p>The Tuktuk tribe is named for its leader, a brave explorer who triggered a magical trap in an ancient ruin and emerged as something else. Curious and adventurous, among the goblins, the Tuktuk are most likely to hire themselves out as ruin guides to other races. Of course, their usual plan is to help find something of value, steal it, trigger a trap intentionally, and then run.</p>
						<p><b>Tuktuk Cunning.</b> You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps, and you have resistance to the damage dealt by traps. In addition, you have proficiency with thieves tools.</p>
