						<p class="major">Humans are the most numerous, diverse, and adaptable folk of Zendikar, and they form the core of most exploratory and adventurous expeditions across the plane. Though many humans huddle behind stone walls and wooden ramparts, at least somewhat protected from the perils of Zendikar, a significant number venture out from the safety of those walls to explore and defend their world.</p>

						<h2>Life on the Frontier</h2>
						<p>Most human communities on Zendikar are tiny villages, remote outposts, or temporary encampments. These settlements are found on every continent, from the coastal villages of Guul Draz to the giant caravan of Goma Fada on Akoum. Without the safety of walls and ramparts, frontier life is all about the struggle for survival, leaving little time or energy for scholarly pursuits. The people of most of these communities rely on hunting, gathering, herding, and trading for the food and other goods they need. Some, however, survive by preying on the people of other communities and caravans.</p>

						<h2>Civilization of Frontiers</h2>
						<p>Despite the harshness of life on Zendikar, human civilization flourishes in a few scattered towns. Sea Gate on Tazeem, Affa on Akoum, and the so-called Free Cities of Nimana on Guul Draz are the most notable of these, boasting organized military forces, institutions of learning, established traditions of magic, houses of worship, and dark underbellies of crime and corruption. With populations measured in the thousands, these settlements would barely qualify as towns on other planes, but they have no rivals on Zendikar except the vampire city of Malakir.</p>

						<h2>The Kargan Tribes</h2>
						<p>Meanwhile, the Kargan tribes of Akoum are fierce human nomads who revere dragons. Each tribe is ruled by a Dragonlord who claims a dragon as a companion and mount. Few challengers would dare dispute a Dragonlord's authority in the face of a dragon's wrath, and taming a dragon is virtually impossible without the support of the whole tribe, so challenges to these leaders' authority are extremely rare. Some Kargan shamans can summon and control dragons, though others focus on the powerful elemental forces of earth and fire. The warriors of the Kargan tribes enter a berserk frenzy they call the dragonrage, which is usually induced by the chanting of a battlesinger.</p>

						<h2>Human Religion</h2>
						<p>Zendikari humans place their faith in the angels. They call out to the angels for protection, for justice, for peace and reassurance, and for healing, and human clerics dispense the angels' blessings among the faithful. Some devotees of the angels aspire to a state of transcendence attained through prayer, meditation, and acts of compassion. Those few who achieve this hallowed state are called luminarchs or transcendent masters, and they glow with their own light, becoming akin to the angels they revere. The First among Angels, according to human belief, is Emeria - a name borrowed from the merfolk sky-goddess. The Sky Ruin above Tazeem, often called simply Emeria (or Emeria's Realm), is watched by angels, and Emeria herself is often depicted as a winged merfolk or angelic figure. Unlike Emeria, who is said to be hidden far above the Sky Ruin, the archangels are concrete, physical objects of devotion for the human faithful. Iona, called Shield of Emeria, and Linvala, Keeper of Silence, are the two most revered of these lesser divinities.</p>
