							<h1>Elves of Zendikar</h1>
							<p>"Wonders hide where the trees grow thickest." ~ Mul Daya proverb</p>
						</header>
						<p class="major">Elves are a fearless and adaptable people. They have fared better than most in the tumultuous environment of Zendikar. They remain the most prevalent race on Murasa, and have a strong presence in other regions as well, most notably Bala Ged. Their treetop villages seem to regrow almost as soon as they are destroyed—much like the Murasan jungles where they are found. Elves are strongly associated with green mana, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.</p>

						<h2>Elvish Appearance</h2>
						<p>Elves are about as tall as humans, but are more slender. Their legs are long, and their pointed ears sweep back from their heads. They move gracefully and hold themselves with elegant poise, but they are a people of the woodlands, and their life in the wilds is manifested in the practical simplicity of their clothes and equipment. Never ones to waste anything that can be reused, elves stitch torn garments together into new ones, and transform broken sword blades into useful gear. They prefer leather for protection rather than metal, which they use to craft swords, spears, arrowheads, and climbing hooks.</p>

						<h2>Prepared Risktakers</h2>
						<p>For the elves, surviving and thriving are deeply interdependent, and this is apparent throughout their daily lives. An elf rarely lacks the equipment for any task that might arise during the day. On the rare occasions when preparation fails, they make up for it with improvisation and quick thinking. Using zip lines and expert climbing techniques, the elves fearlessly span the gaps between branches or cliff faces. Indeed, some of the branch paths elves take are impassable without their guidance and skills, as they often leap breaches and climb hidden trails. Confident that they can handle any threat or obstacle, Zendikar's elves are risk takers by nature, and they believe that nothing can be gained without some venture of risk. They're not usually foolhardy, but they stand in the face of danger with courageous calm.</p>

						<h2>Elvish Life</h2>
						<p>Elves live in small village clans. Leadership is decentralized and communal, although those with a combination of age and the particular skills relevant to a given decision tend to take the lead. Elvish social organization reflects their high degree of self-sufficiency. Individuals are expected to look after their own needs first and foremost, then those of their families, and finally those of the clan at large. Most clans are part of one of the three major elvish "nations," which are regional populations more than coherent states.</p>

						<h2>A Different Perspective</h2>
						<p>Elves live much longer than humans. Perhaps as a result, they have a very different experience of time than humans do. From their perspective, it is perfectly natural that past generations should persist among the living in spirit form, blending past and present in an eternal instant. Similarly, there's nothing exceptional about the land changing, whether it takes place over centuries or in moments as a result of the Roil. To humans, this sense of time dilation can seem like a spiritual experience, but the elves ascribe no special significance to it. They generally do not see mystical truths, transcendental weight, or a divine hand in events, however extraordinary they may be.</p>

			<!-- Tajuru -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" >
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Tajuru Nation</h2>
						<p>The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans. Tajuru elves are the most open to people of other races, seeing their skills and perspectives as valuable new tools for survival. The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.</p>
						<p><b>Skill Versatility.</b> You gain proficiency in any combination of two skills or tools of your choice.</p>

			<!-- Joraga -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="joraga">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Joraga Nation</h2>
						<p>The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar — or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves’ only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans’ aggressive exterior.</p>
						<p><b>Fleet of Foot.</b> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet. 
							<br><b>Mask of the Wild.</b> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>

			<!-- Mul Daya -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="mul-daya">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Mul Daya Nation</h2>
						<p>Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged and Murasa are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order. Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.</p>
						<p><b>Superior Darkvision.</b> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet. 
							<br><b>Sunlight Sensitivity.</b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. 
							<br><b>Mul Daya Magic.</b> You know the <em>chill touch</em> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <em>hex</em> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <em>darkness</em> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
