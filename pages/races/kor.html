							<h1>The Kor</h1>
							<p>"We were not meant to put down roots. The heart is a moving organ." 
								~ Kor saying								
								</p>
						</header>
						<p class="major">Deeply reverent of the land and its sacred sites, the nomadic Kor live a spare existence defined by their constant travels. Masters of ropes and hooks, they scale sheer cliffs and cross yawning chasms with such skill and agility that they sometimes seem almost to take flight. Kor are associated with white mana, and their wizards and clerics employ spells of healing, of banishing the dark, and of protection. Their personalities and ideals also mesh with the characteristics of white mana in their emphasis on an ordered, harmonious community with strong traditions binding its members together.</p>

						<h2>Kor Appearance</h2>
						<p>Kor are tall, slender humanoids with light hair and gray, blue-gray, or ivory skin. All kor have slightly pointed ears, and males have short, fleshy barbels on their chins. They paint softly glowing geometric patterns on their faces and bodies, suggestive of the shapes and design of the hedrons that appear across Zendikar. Their clothing tends to leave their arms and shoulders free to facilitate climbing, and they keep most of their gear in pouches and slings at their waists. The kor have a nonverbal language of hand signs and gestures that allows communication despite significant distance (particularly when augmented with whirling ropes) or howling winds. They also use this sign language among themselves when they wish to avoid being overheard, giving rise to misguided rumors that they are incapable of speech. When they do speak, they typically use as few words as possible to convey their meaning.</p>

						<h2>Kor Pilgrimages</h2>
						<p>Another common misconception about the kor is that, as perpetual nomads, they have no ties to specific locations. In fact, they revere dozens of sacred sites across Zendikar, and they spend their lives in constant pilgrimage along routes that can take decades to complete. Most of their sacred sites are natural features such as lakes, springs, waterfalls, promontories, pillars, caves, trees, or floating chunks of earth. A few are ancient ruins that the kor believe are connected either to their racial history or to the activity of their gods. In theory, the pilgrimage routes should be drastically altered by the movements of the Roil, but the sites display a remarkable stability that can leave them the only constant in an ever-shifting landscape. A few sacred sites are gone, but most have remained unchanged for centuries.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Tied to the Land</h2>
						<p>The kor travel in small bands of about a dozen on their ceaseless pilgrimages. When a band arrives at a sacred site, its members perform what they call the landbind ritual, taking up some of the soil or gravel from the site and rubbing it on their skin. They believe that this ritual reestablishes their spiritual connection with the site and connects them in turn with all the other kor who have visited that location in the past. Thus they strengthen and affirm their links to the past and to their racial community beyond their own bands. The oldest kor, who have survived long enough to visit the same site multiple times, believe that they are also reestablishing their ties to their past selves. These ties to the past can take concrete form in the manifestation of spirits, returned from death to aid their living kin or protect the sacred sites.</p>

						<h2>Kor Religion</h2>
						<p>The kor traditionally worship a pantheon of deities who represent distinct aspects of nature. Talib, the Body of the World, is the harsh and unyielding god of the earth, who crushes the unworthy in rockslides and pits but also provides herbs and fungi to forage along the pilgrimage routes. Kamsa, the Breath of the World, is the benevolent goddess of wind, who fills the kitesails of the kor and provides them with game for the hunt, such as flying eels. Mangeni, the Blood of the World, is the unpredictable god of the sea, who fills the canyons and streams with rushing water and punishes the stagnation of kor-those who erect buildings in defiance of the traditional ways.</p>

						<h2>World-Gifts</h2>
						<p>As part of its religious observance, a kor family offers a child to the gods in hopes of appeasing the world's natural forces. This "world-gift" is typically the second-born child, who is left at one of the sacred sites as the kor move along their pilgrimage. Most of these children die quickly, but a surprising number are found and taken in by explorers. These kor adopt the language and culture of their new families, but as they grow they are often driven by wanderlust to venture back out into the wilds. They are never welcomed back to the kor, but many find gainful work on adventurous expeditions.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Masters of Hooks and Ropes</h2>
						<p>The kor are masters of ropes and hooks, which they use to travel and to hunt. They rarely use unreliable devices such as crossbows to propel their grappling hooks onto cliff faces or into flying game. They rely instead on simple, sturdy rope and the skill of the arm. Ropes and hooks are also incorporated into their spirituality. A hooked line is a social and sacred symbol for the kor that represents their connection to each other and to the world around them. In addition to their ropes, some kor use small gliders called kitesails for scouting or hunting. They are particularly effective in the trenches and canyons of Ondu, where fierce winds can keep them aloft for miles.</p>

				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Masters of the Sky</h2>
						<p>Through personal experience and received tradition, the nomadic kor are intimately familiar with the terrain and perils of Zendikar's lands, and they turn this familiarity into a solid advantage when battling predators and foes. They prefer to move in three dimensions whenever possible, using cliff faces and overhangs, which puts them on equal footing with flying beasts and gives them a clear edge over those who are confined to the ground. The kor are known to engage their foes at choke points or force them into treacherous terrain. If they can't use the natural landscape to their advantage, they create complex webs of and lines that slow down or ensnare the enemy. When a larger beast, such as a dragon, is spotted, separate kor bands join forces and swarm it, using their climbing hooks to tear at the monstrosity and their ropes to restrain its movement.</p>

			<!-- History -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>A Missing History</h2>
						<p>The kor believe that their race had a very different way of life in the distant past, in which they built permanent towns with great citadels, palaces, and temples. As the Roil tears across the land, the devastation it wreaks has the unintended side effect of uncovering numerous ancient ruins long ago swallowed by the earth, and some of these might in fact be evidence of this ancient kor civilization, particularly in Akoum and Ondu. Surviving world-gifts, in particular, often act as guides for members of other races who venture into the newly exposed ruins in hopes of discovering knowledge that can be used to explain their past and solve the mysteries of Zendikar.</p>
