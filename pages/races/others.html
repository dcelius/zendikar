					<div class="content">
						<h2>Aasimar/Tieflings</h2>
						<p>Aasimar/Tieflings on Zendikar are uncommon. Deities tend to stay oddly distant from Zendikar, but their representatives, the celestials and devils that serve them, make frequent appearances. This means the presence of celestial and infernal energies in mortal bloodlines, while uncommon, is not unheard of. Aasimars/Tieflings commonly become adventurers on Zendikar due to their innate connection to otherworldly powers, which is considered an advantage to the Expeditionary Houses. Aasimar are sometimes hailed as blessings from the gods by humans, being descended from the angels that drive their religious beliefs.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Dragonborn</h2>
						<p>Dragonborn on Zendikar are quite rare, and generally can only be found on the isles of Beyeen by Ondu or high in the Teeth of Akoum. Dragonborn tend to live fairly remote and isolated lives, seeking the raw red mana that pours out of the volcanoes they gravitate towards.</p>

			<!-- Firbolgs -->

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Firbolg</h2>
						<p>Firbolg on Zendikar are fairly rare, only being seen in small cloisters, far from civilization, deep in the Turntimber forest on Ondu and in the southernmost parts of the Oran-Rief forest on Tazeem. Living isolated from other races, the firbolgs of Zendikar hunt baloths and other large game, living in close harmony with the woodland. Some legends hold that the firbolgs are not related by blood to giants at all, but were originally druids who became giant-like only after years of living among the twisted trees.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Hobgoblins</h2>
						<p>Hobgoblins on Zendikar are fairly uncommon, only really found amongst the Lavastep tribe of goblins that live near the fiery fissures and volcanoes of Akoum. Here they lead the goblins in warfare, using their tactical minds to their advantage.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Leonin</h2>
						<p>Leonin on Zendikar are rare with the exception of Ondu, where they can be found scattered across the continent, preferring the arid scrub and grasslands rather than the forests of Turntimber. Living together in prides, the leonin tend to spend most of their days fighting off and hunting down the roving groups of bandits that stalk the Makindi Trenches.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Loxodons</h2>
						<p>Loxodon on Zendikar are uncommon, but can be found in greater populations in central Akoum, with a notable population being a part of the caravan city, Goma Fada. Being naturally strong and also born wanderers, loxodon are some of the most essential residents of Goma Fada, and make up a significant portion of the unofficial council that governs the massive caravan.</p>

			<!-- Minotaurs -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="minotaur">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Minotaurs</h2>
						<p>Minotaurs on Zendikar are uncommon, but can be found in a variety of places. However, they tend to concentrate in mountains, canyons, and other rough terrain. The most notable locations for minotaurs are in the Makindi Trenches on Ondu, and along the Cliffs of Murasa. Minotaurs are often savage and cruel. But they are also capable of fighting with discipline, cooperating with members of other races against a common foe, and carefully following orders—if the pay is good enough. Minotaurs are strongly associated with red mana. Their fierce tempers, passionate emotions, and lust for battle align with the characteristics of red mana, and their shamans (though they are rare) favor the mountain magic of earth and stone. They are often reckless and unpredictable, throwing their opponents off balance and then pressing their advantage.</p>

			<!-- Satyrs -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="satyr">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Satyrs</h2>
						<p>Satyrs on Zendikar are incredibly rare, and are usually only found in one or two small clusters in the Turntimber forest on Ondu. These satyrs generally just try to live a happy and carefree life, so they tend to stick to themselves. The rare few satyrs that set out on an adventure will provide stories enough to their people upon their return to last generations.</p>

						<h2>Vedalken</h2>
						<p>Vedalken on Zendikar are fairly rare, but a small group of these naturally intelligent folk are present in almost every merfolk enclave. There is also a notable population in Sea Gate, being stewards and researchers of the Lighthouse. Naturally curious, and generally wealthy and well-connected, the veldalken are responsible for funding a majority of the expedition requests sent to the Sea Gate Expeditionary Houses.</p>
