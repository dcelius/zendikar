							<h1>Vampires of Zendikar</h1>
							<p>"The vampires know something. If only they could stop killing each other for one second and remember, maybe we would know more about our world." 
								~ Anitan, Ondu cleric

						<p class="major">Born into ancient servitude and bred to a life of decadent corruption, the vampires of Zendikar feed on the energy in the blood of living creatures—an energy that is particularly strong in times of terror and pain. To members of the other races, vampires are a fearsome mystery and the stuff of nightmares, hunting their prey like beasts or reclining on thrones made of skulls in their moss-draped cities. But few understand how the vampires are locked in a brutal civil war. On one side are those who hold to their traditional ways, desperately battling to remain free. On the other side are those vampires whose legacy reaches back into the deepest recesses of history. Vampires are associated with black mana. Their existence is predicated on draining the life from others to fuel their own existence, and on putting their own lives ahead of all other concerns. Philosophically, they do not constrain themselves with artificial rules of morality, but believe that the strong can and should take what they need from the weak.</p>

						<h2>Vampire Appearance</h2>
						<p>The vampires of Zendikar are not undead. Rather, their unique nature comes from an eldritch disease that turns their flesh cold, makes their gray or purple skin feel dead to the touch, and enables them to drain concentrated magical energy from the blood of other living creatures. They are tall and slender, with long, elegant necks and broad shoulders. Bony horns protrude from their shoulders and elbows, often augmented by the layered plates of their armor and clothing. Their canine teeth are slightly elongated, but not enough to protrude between their closed lips. Vampires dress in leather and the chitin carapaces of the gigantic insects that dwell in the swamps and jungles of their native Guul Draz, augmented with fine silk and gauzy fabric. They decorate their skin in elaborate, symmetrical patterns of red paint made from blood and mineral pigments. Their clothing is an odd mixture of complex layers and elaborate patterns combined with plenty of exposed skin, since their cold bodies are unaffected by the temperature around them.</p>

						<h2>Decadence and Debauchery</h2>
						<p>Vampire civilization is perhaps the most refined and cultured among all the races of Zendikar. Vampire cities are places of decadent splendor, ornamented with grotesque art, macabre ornamentation, and the stately courts of the ruling bloodchiefs. The vampires live comfortable lives of luxury, attended by legions of faceless undead thralls called nulls. The bloodchiefs are the central figures of vampire society. Having been directly infected by the eldritch curse that turned them, they in turn created the masses of other vampires, each establishing a family that owes allegiance to its chief. The tastes and passions of an individual bloodchief tend to be imprinted on the vampires he or she creates, so each vampire family shares certain tendencies of behavior and personality. Unfortunately, most bloodchiefs tend toward violent insanity, though a handful are more benevolent than the rest. The bloodchiefs originally numbered in the hundreds, but centuries of brutal rivalry among the vampire families winnowed their number down to barely a dozen. With only a few large vampire families having a foothold in Malakir, the vampires from smaller families live in small settlements dragged on giant sledges by vampire nulls deep in the swamps of Guul Draz. Small and mobile, these sledge-camps are dangerous and predatory, often attacking the settlements of other races for food and new null servants. A typical sledge-camp consists of thirty or so vampires and as many nulls to serve them.</p>

						<h2>Collaboration</h2>
						<p>Working with other races is difficult for the vampires, much as a tiger working on a team with humans would be. There's no escaping the fact that no matter how closely their goals align, one member of the team sees another member as a potential meal. A vampire's blood hunger can be controlled but never truly suppressed. Still, some vampires have tried to integrate into the settlements and war bands of other races, with mixed results. Some settlements of kor and humans see the benefit in having a vampire working with them and are willing to give up some of their own blood in exchange for the assistance of a creature with superhuman strength, agility, and intelligence. When these arrangements fail, though, the outcome is predictably tragic for all involved.</p>

								<h3>Age</h3>
								<p>Vampires don’t mature and age in the same way that other races do. Every living vampire is either a bloodchief, infected by the original eldritch curse, or was spawned by a bloodchief from a living human. Most vampires are thus very old, but few have any memory of their earliest years.</p>

								<h3>Alignment</h3>
								<p>Vampires have no innate tendency toward evil, but consuming the life energy of other creatures often pushes them to that end. Regardless of their moral bent, the strict hierarchies of their bloodchiefs inclines them toward a lawful alignment.</p>

								<h3>Darkvision</h3>
								<p>Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

								<h3>Blood Thirst</h3>
								<p>You can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid killed in this way becomes a null.</p>
