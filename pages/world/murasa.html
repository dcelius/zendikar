							<p>"Those who think the trees shall remain bystanders to conflict in Murasa shall be sorely mistaken."

						<p>Murasa is an island: a vast, steep-walled plateau that rises sharply from the sea. Sheer, stony cliffs form an almost impenetrable wall around its perimeter, which drops off sharply to the interior. Only four reliable routes pass through Murasa's Wall, and most of them require the assistance of guides - or the payment of heavy tolls.</p>

						<p>While not as remote as Sejiri or as deadly as its climate, Murasa maintains the reputation for having the most unforgiving and dangerous collection of flora and fauna in all of Zendikar. Harabaz, jaddi, and jurworrel trees form distinctive environments in different parts of the island. The aerial jellyfish called gomazoa, enormous four-legged predators called terra stompers, and gigantic jagwasps are examples of the peculiar animals native to Murasa's jungles.</p>

						<p>A thick mat of leaves, flowers, ferns, vines, and shrubs covers most of verdant Murasa. Dense jungles blanket the land, from the edges of the towering cliffs along its coasts to the inland heart of the continent. Leafy plants cling to the rocky ridges, fill damp crevasses to bursting, and reach high up into the sky where they clutch at floating rocks and worn hedron stones. Clinging vines wind through deep valleys, up cliff walls, and down into caverns in the earth, where they hang in midair. The growth is irrepressible - though numerous cataclysms have brought ruin to the land, Murasa has regrown its jungles time after time.</p>

						<h2>The Murasa Wall</h2>
						<p>The Murasa Wall is made up of towering cliffs that surround the continent. Inland from these cliffs, the land drops off sharply. Storm clouds pour over the cliffs from the ocean, depositing their warm rain, and dissipating by the time they hit the center of the continent.</p>

						<h2>The Cliffs of Kazuul and the Kazuul Road</h2>
						<p>In one spot on Murasa's towering cliffs, the Tajuru elves created a passable route over the wall. The route, consisting of steep, winding switchbacks and a few rickety wooden lifts, is now maintained by humans and guarded by ogres, all in the service of an ogre named Kazuul. Upon reaching the top, travelers must pay tribute to Kazuul, and if the Tyrant of the Cliffs is not satisfied, he hurls them right back down the way they came as punishment for their impudence.</p>

He enjoys throwing his weight around and maintains his hold on the cliffs by being stronger than any challenger so far. In addition to the passage up the cliffs, Kazuul claims ownership to a network of mines inside Murasa's Wall, dug from the inland side of the mountains.</p>

						<h2>Sunder Cove</h2>
						<p>This huge bay is filled with a maze of the multi-trunked harabaz trees. Gripping the seabed with their entwined roots, these towering plants join together to form one giant organism. The harabaz trees grow blade-shaped prows on their scaward sides that cut the giant waves that smash into the bay - particularly during the worst of the tides or after the rising of a kraken or the great sea monster Lorthos. Ships attempting to make passage through the harabaz forest must remain vigilant against submerged tree trunks and maintain tight control of their vessels to avoid being smashed. Making passage during the changing of the tides, a storm, or a manifestation of the unpredictable Roil spells certain doom.</p>

						<p>Elves of the Tajuru tribe and their merfolk allies often attempt to mark the safest route through the bay, but new hazards arise all too often. If the elves spot a sundered ship, they quickly try to save the crew, but no elf risks travel through the harabaz forest at night or when the water is rough. Due to its danger it can take much longer than the Kazuul Road, so the more wealthy adventurers tend to just pay Kazuul for safe transit rather than risk Sunder Cove.</p>

						<h2>The Tumbled Palace</h2>
						<p>The elf nation of the Tajuru is the largest of the three elf nations and accounts for most of the elf population on Murasa. The individual clans that make up the nation are scattered across Zendikar, including several different clans on Murasa alone, but they all acknowledge the leadership of a young tracker named Nisede. The shamans who used to lead the Tajuru nation took up residence in the Tumbled Palace, a crumbling edifice on the cliff of Sunder Bay. The ancient palace is clutched in the boughs of a huge jurworrel tree that has lifted it up from the cliffs and holds it suspended in the air. Although the perch seems precarious, as though the palace might fall into the bay at any moment, it has hung suspended in this manner for as long as even the elves can remember. For her part, Nisede does not like spending time in the Tumbled Palace - not because she fears the drop, but because she prefers living in the wilds, in constant motion. Her followers believe that the land speaks to her directly.</p>

						<h2>Jurworrel Trees</h2>
						<p>Jurworrel trees grow on cliff sides and rock outcroppings across Murasa. Their dark, twisting branches bristle with thorns, which leak a thick green sap that can knock creatures unconscious. Jurworrels possess some measure of intelligence but have no ability to move except by changing the direction of their slow growth. The jurworrel beneath the Tumbled Palace has been trying to push that edifice into the sea for centuries for reasons that are unknown to the elves. Many of the elves of Murasa live on the enormous branches of jurworrel and jaddi trees, and they build villages and roadways along the branch surfaces. They construct elegant, almost hedron-like structures. structures surrounding smaller branches, linking them together with graceful rope bridges. Some structures are even built on the sides of the great trunks and branches.</p>

						<h2>Glint Pass</h2>
						<p>A blue sea cave leads under the cast side of the Wall, and at its rear lies a cavern opening accessible when the tide is low. If a traveler follows this cave far enough before the tide rises to fill it again, the way through Glint Pass lies open. Although miles of the pass lie in utter darkness, the caverns of the Glint Pass gained their name from the light given off by flame-quartz, clusters of crystals that jut from the rock throughout much of the underground passage. These faceted stones shine with the light of internal fire, like lanterns lit by fires in the earth. In some places along the trail, the fire of the earth is obvious as the path wends its way over rivers of magma. Glint Pass is a bewildering labyrinth, but vampire guides from Visimal, the Hidden City, are often available to steer travelers on their way. </p>

It is said that those who can survive the journey and decipher its magical instructions can perform a ritual that transports them anywhere in the world. Whether or not this is true or what other effects the cipher might have are unknown-none have returned from seeking it except a bedraggled few who found the search too perilous or who failed to read its magic.</p>

						<p>A section of Murasa's Wall on the eastern side of the island is cracked and broken into thousands of massive pillars, the tops of which are grassy dwelt plains buffeted by sea winds. For generations a clan of kor atop the pillars, living a simple herders' lifestyle, a strange blend of the pastoral and perilous. They crossed between the pillars on bridges they crafted of rope and bone, or they swung from leaning monoliths to cross the gaps that their oxen could simply leap. Living in simple tents and herding the hardy pillarfield oxen, they received all else they needed through trade with travelers through Thunder Gap. Now the campsites are abandoned, the oxen run feral across the pillar-fields, and only a memory of the kor haunts the Pillar Plains. </p>

The river splits many times as it passes through the Pillar Plains, but these side channels typically rejoin with the river in crashing waterfalls. Its waters are difficult but navigable for a few miles inland from the ocean, but after that most of its length consists of thundering rapids supplemented by roaring waterfalls from the top of the wall and from higher side channels.</p>

						<h2>Thunder Gap</h2>
						<p>This passage follows the route of the rushing Vazi River as it heads out to sea. Boats can navigate the rough waters for a few miles inland through the canyon of Thunder Gap, but travelers must then disembark and take the precarious trails and rope bridges chat run along the canyon walls, across the thundering water, and beneath or above the many waterfalls that burst from side canyons or the plains above. Some trails lead up and out of the canyon, while others follow the river for its length, eventually leading to the ground beyond Murasa’s Wall. Thunder Gap used to be known as the safest means into the interior, for it was well maintained by Tajuru elves and a clan of kor that lived along the Pillar Plains above Thunder Gap. But two decades ago, something happened to the kor. Travelers found kor bodies all along the path of Thunder Gap, their corpses hung like butcher's meat from their own hooked lines. The trail hasn't been maintained since, and the most shadowed sections of the pass are said to be haunted by tortured kor ghosts.</p>

With each symbol being about 6 feet high, the Wall of Omens runs for around a mile in total, and the symbols stretch all the way from the jungle floor to the top of the cliffs. Complex, winding, and alien, the script itself has been seen nowhere else on Zendikar, and as such, no one knows for sure what it says. Some adventurers that have managed to reach this remote site claim that the wall spoke to them, granting them cryptic prophecies they dare not speak aloud. All recorded witnesses to the Wall of Omens have been driven mad by their experience at the Wall and the prophecies they claim to have been given.</p>

Those who wish to get over the mountains must brave the dangers of its beasts and the perils of its ‘fangs,' huge stalactite-like shards of rock that float above the mountains when the sun shines on them but plummet down to stab the mountainsides when the sun sets or when a passing cloud blocks the light.</p>

						<p>Flying is the safest way to go through the Skytang Mountains, but the next best option is traveling by way of the aptly named Shatterskull Pass. A wide trail passes through on a relatively shallow incline, but dozens of rock fungs hang above the pass, their bottoms blunted into flat surfaces by countless ground-shuddering impacts into the earth. Travelers through Shatterskull must beware not only the fall of the fangs but also raiding bands of giants and minotaurs, as well as the mating pair of rocs that live in the mountains nearby.</p>

This collapse left a broken landscape of irregular canyons, twisting valleys, and high broken steppes, all dotted here and there by plateaus that tower above the landscape, marking the previous ground level. Most of the lower areas are dominated by the towering jaddi trees, many growing nearly as tall as the plateaus.</p>

The trees are so tall and their branches so wide that the ground beneath them is draped in eternal shadow. Jaddi trees grow slowly but dauntlessly, and are not known to have a maximum lifespan. The cliffs that encircle the Kazandu lowlands are the only things keeping the jaddi trees from covering the rest of Murasa. The wood of a jaddi tree is as hard as stone and grows over cuts. Entire species of animals can live and die in the jaddi canopies without ever seeing the ground.</p>

From these branches and through the canopies of the jaddi trees, the mighty Raimunza River begins its roaring, albeit convoluted, march to the Living Spire at the center of Kazandu. At the top of the falls is a scattering of brick shops and dwellings - a mining town inhabited mostly by humans and a few Tajuru elves. The mines themselves are crude, shallow caves dug into the cliff face to extract iron ore from the rock. The fast-flowing water turns gigantic wheels along the length of the falls, which operate great winches to lift miners and their extracted ore to and from the mines. Unable to compete with Kazuul in larger markers across Zendikar, the people of Raimunza process and work the metal themselves, selling finished goods to the elves or traders from other lands.</p>

Once the larvae mature and leave the area, new mines are often begun in the caves they abandon.</p>

						<p>The Singing City is a cyclopean maze of strange structures and tumbled towers hidden somewhere near the center of the enormous Na Plateau. Known by legend throughout Zendikar, the Singing City is named for the eerie, almost musical sounds that come from underground chambers below the ruined buildings. The sounds have driven many explorers mad, causing them to turn on companions or hurl themselves from great heights, but enough have survived with proof of great treasures and powerful magic to draw others to grim fates. Goblin tribes dwell around the ruin, offering aid to those who would enter the Singing City and then hovering like vultures in the surrounding trees, waiting for their chance to pick up the pieces.</p>

						<h2>Song-Mad Goblins</h2>
						<p>Goblins that go too deep and too often into the Singing City inevitably go "song-mad." These poor wretches are banished from their tribes to stumble drunkenly about the ruins, absently crooning in tuneless imitation of their song. Left alone, they are harmless and eventually waste away, but removing one beyond the range of hearing the city's singing drives a song-mad goblin into a frenzy. Goblin tribes at war with one another offen sweep the city to gather as many of the song-mad as they can. They then strap blades to them and tie weapons into their fists. These song-mad goblins are prodded into battle by other goblins and then released among the foe. The screeching creatures thrash wildly about, causing havoc and casualties - often on both sides of the conflict - until they are killed.</p>

						<h2>The Murasa Skyclave</h2>
						<p>Due to its depth underwater, this was the most recently discovered Skyclave and was only found thanks to recent advancements in expeditionary technology allowing for such deep dives. Unfortunately, this ruined Skyclave is also home to Lorthos, the Slumbering Tidemaker, a gigantic kraken who can move the ocean with his will. No further expeditions have been officially sanctioned to prevent waking up the great beast.</p>

							<h2>Lorthos, the Tidemaker</h2>
							<p>"When Lorthos emerges from his deepwater realm, the tides bow to his will, and the coastline cowers in his presence." ~ Ayli, Kamsa cleric</p>
						</header>
						<p>Murasa is home to many large creatures, including summit apes, jagwasps, terra stompers, baloths, thunder eels, and gomazoa, not to mention the enormous jaddi trees. But dwelling outside Sunder Bay is a creature so large that his movements affect the tides - Lorthos the Tidemaker. In the past, Speaker Sutina of the Tajuru elf nation was suspected of having some connection to the Tidemaker, since she was often seen on the cliffs of Sunder Bay when Lorthos's great tides surged through the harabaz trees. Sutina's death, though, has not altered the frequency of the great creature's appearances.</p>
