							<h1>Akoum</h1>
							<p>"We move because the earth does."
								~ Bruse Tari, Gama Fada nomad								
								</p>
						</header>
						<p>Jagged mountain peaks rise high into the air, topped by gravity defying arches and spires. Titanic structures of crystalline rock formations, abyssal crevasses where magma bubbles and flows, desolate badlands of eroded volcanic rock, geysers of sulfurous water and vents of toxic gasses - all these features define the harsh landscape of Akoum. Floating mountains, unmoored from the earth, hover in defiance of gravity, extending the uneven landscape upward as far as the eye can see. From the jagged obsidian cliffs at the coast to the soaring mountains called the Teeth of Akoum in the north, the region is bristling with angular spikes as if the land itself is trying to ward off any encroachment.</p>

						<p>Life in Akoum is harsh, perhaps more so than anywhere else on Zendikar. But, this sprawling and geologically unstable continent is home to a variety of peoples, with the largest “settlement” being Goma Fada, a colossal caravan that roams across the unforgiving terrain. While this continent is by far the largest on Zendikar, and the most geologically central, due to its incredibly sparse flora, fauna, and freshwater, Akoum is less populated than half the other continents on the plane. The majority of residents here are human, but a few notable collections of elves inhabit the region around Ora Ondar, and Kor and Goblins can be found here in greater numbers than anywhere else on Zendikar.</p>

						<p>Most of the land is cracked and dry, but hardy plants and animals find a way to thrive in unlikely places. Trees and shrubs cluster around volcanic gas vents, defining environments unlike anything else on Zendikar. Aggressive silver and blue grasses take root in volcanic stone and spread rapidly, providing meager fare for the larger fauna of the region. From time to time a volcanic burst brings fertile earth to the surface, and Akoum springs into beautiful flora in an event the elves call a "life bloom ." Creatures that can survive this rugged land are as tough and dangerous as their environment. Even the mammals have some form of hard carapace or shell, and many forms of insect life, from tiny beetles to enormous burrowing geopedes, thrive in the ground. Various kinds of elementals - living embodiments of earth, fire, and magma - are the most common predators.</p>

							<h2>The Roil on Akoum</h2>
							<p>"My boots are in ribbons. The steeds' hooves bleed. We carry too much tinder and not enough water. We would have no motivation to continue to the ruins except that it's just as far back to the coast again." ~ Journal of Prina Wey</p>
						</header>
						<p>Akoum is essentially one enormous volcano, though it is not prone to major eruptions. Instead, because of the Roil , the whole region is constantly shaken by more minor activity. The Roil's activity is primarily felt from below - not in air or water, but in the earth and the fiery magma that is never too far from the surface. Lava flows alternately flood and clear tunnels, sometimes causing gases from deep within the earth to vent explosively to the surface, and the shuddering earth can bring down a rain of crystalline shards as deadly as a volley of arrows.</p>

						<h2>The Cliffs of Akoum</h2>
						<p>The hazardous coastal cliffs of Akoum are a deathtrap to travelers. Spires of volcanic glass jut from the sea, lava flows cascade from the cliffs, and seaquakes send high tidal waves crashing in, so few harbors allow ships access to the shore. After braving a journey filled with krakens and storms, it is not uncommon for a ship to meet its end within sight of the Akoum shores, the hull torn apart on jagged underwater rocks essentially invisible to a lookout's eye. Akoum has no permanent ports. The coastline changes significantly every year because of volcanic eruptions, above and below the water, and seismic activity that sends coastal shelves into the ocean depths. Still, upon sighting a ship, any people living on the coast make every attempt to bring it in since the ship might carry valuable supplies simply not available elsewhere on Akoum.</p>

						<h2>The Teeth</h2>
						<p>Much of Akoum is covered with jagged mountains. The so-called Teeth of Akoum are a series of broken mountain ranges that are extremely difficult to navigate. Riding griffins carry travelers from Affa to the handful of camps nestled among the peaks, but only a very clever explorer can forge a path through the gullies and gorges to find an uncharted ruin or a hidden mine. The land itself is dangerous enough, but the mountains are also home to fierce dragons and the savage human barbarians who revere them, the Kargan tribes. Hellions--enormous wurm-like creatures that swim through lava--occasionally burst to the surface here as well, devouring anything that moves.</p>

						<h2>The Spikefields</h2>
						<p>Crystalline fields shimmer in a rainbow of colors beneath the harsh sun. This awe-inspiring beauty hides a deadly reality. The smallest stone carries sharp edges that can slice through leather and flesh when an unwary traveler slips and falls. What's more, the surface can reach extremes of temperature - during the day, the sun’s glare on the gleaming crystals creates blistering heat, but the stone cools quickly, and the cloudless sky can make for bitterly cold nights.</p>

						<h2>Affa</h2>
						<p>A mostly human settlement at the base of the Teeth - though elves, kor, and even the occasional vampire will call it home for a time. A river flows from the Teeth and provides the town with one of the few reliable sources of fresh water on the continent. Affa's bazaar serves as the major trading hub in the region, and goblins, especially from the Lavastep Warren, bring materials for trade. The Akoum Expeditionary House, based in Sea Gate, maintains a hostel in Affa run by a cheerful, heavily scarred human named Sachir.</p>
						<p><b>Windblast Gorge.</b> A dangerous passage that leads into the mountains from Affa, known for its dangerous drakes.</p>

							<h2>Goma Fada</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Perhaps the strangest population center in all of Zendikar is not technically a settlement at all. Goma Fada, literally, "The City that Walks,” is an enormous caravan constantly on the move across Akoum. It consists of several thousand people - mostly humans and kor, with a few elves and merfolk - along with hundreds of huge sturdy carts pulled by horses, oxen, and the strange, giant-like beasts called hurdas. The carts comprise homes, shops, eateries, and even farms of sorts - fig trees and similar hardy plants are grown in dirt-filled backs of wagons. Cisterns full of water and granaries laden with food are drawn along by the enormous beasts of burden.</p>

							<h2></h2>
							<p>"All the major routes of the region - the Rogah Throughway, Akoum's Belt, the Pass of Woe - were carved by the wagon wheels of Goma Fada. The greatest explorer of Akoum isn't Sachir or Kala the Bold - it's the Walking City itself." ~ Chronicle of Vurundi</p>
						</header>
						<p>Goma Fada faces all the challenges of life on Akoum by never sitting still for long. Since resources can appear and disappear at a moment's notice, the caravan hauls supplies of food and drink to last months and sends roving warscouts - part explorer and part engineer - to find the ephemeral streams that appear after rainfall and channel the flow into the caravans cisterns. Of course, the dangers of Akoum often move faster than the caravan, but the tenacious folk of Goma Fada have survived so far. The ground is not always strong enough to support the massive carts and wagons of the caravan. Light outriders travel before the main body of the caravan, testing the ground before the great wagons arrive. The rolling city avoids most of the crystalline Spike Fields because of the weak ground, though it sometimes sends smaller wagon trains across the fields to trade with the goblin warren called the Slab. The yearly path that Goma Fada takes stretches across most of the continent: from Affa, they follow the river down to the coast, then travel southeast to the Glasspool, then northwest, skirting by the edge of the Spikefields, passing by the mountain route to Fort Keff, before returning to Affa at the end of the year.</p>

							<h2>Tal Terig</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Rising hundreds of feet high out of the Spikefields is an ancient structure known as Tal Terig, or The Puzzle Tower. One of the most famous sites on Akoum, the ruin's exterior is a pillar of seemingly randomly assembled geometric shapes of all sizes - ranging from tiny decorative cubes jutting from the surface to enormous tetrahedrons, 20 feet on a side, that make up a significant portion of the structure. The angles and lines of the tower appear to defy the bounds of logic. Some have reported headaches and nosebleeds after looking at its surface for short spans of time. Reportedly, the portion of Tal Terig that juts above the surface of the ground is just a small portion of the tower's enormous size.</p>

							<p>"Life is a maze. This is one of its dead ends." ~ Noyan Dar, Tazeem lullmage</p>
						</header>
						<p>Every time an explorer claims to have reached the lowest level, another one discovers some new shaft or stairway leading still farther down. Within the labyrinthine halls and chambers, delvers have found great riches and powerful items of magic, though reports of curses and misfortune seem to trail in the wake of items recovered from Tal Terig. As expected, the site is as deadly as it is valuable. Kor spirits haunt the halls, and many constructs of animated stone guard against intruders. Magical traps line each and every hall, and the halls of the spire rotate and cycle, ensuring that no trap learned by explorers stays exactly the same for long. The sound of grinding stone carries for miles from the tower, and it's a sound that tells the few creatures brave enough to serve as guides that all their hard-earned information about the layout of the ruin has just become obsolete.</p>

						<h2>Ora Ondar, the Khalni Garden</h2>
						<p>Sometimes called the Impossible Garden, this oasis of growth in the harsh angular setting of Akoum has remained a fixture of the land under the power of a life bloom for almost a hundred years, and calling this lush tangle of magical, and occasionally deadly, plants a "garden" is the height of irony. Thick clusters of ferns cover the ground, with gigantic flowers rising above them to catch the sun. Thorny vines twist up the stems of the taller plants, and giant pitcher plants and flytraps catch and devour the smaller animals that venture into the wood. The small kolya trees, their slender trunks topped with narrow leaves hung with glowing green fruits, are the tallest plants here.</p>

						<h2>Khalni Elves</h2>
						<p>A small clan of Tajuru elves lives among the stone crannies of a large outcropping in the midst of the forest. These elves call themselves "nourishers'' and consider it their mission to help sustain the forest. A few human druids and merfolk lullmages have joined the elves here to nurture the Khalni Garden and try to shield it from the tumult of the land. The succulent fruit of the kolya tree has magical properties, thanks to the trees property of absorbing mana from the land. The sweet, tangy fruit has unpredictable effects on those who eat it, ranging from supernatural enhancement of strength or intellect to the creation of phosphorescence in the blood that makes the eater's veins glow through the skin. Certain elf druids, believing that the gifts of the ancestors are contained in the fruit, eat it as part of their spiritual practice. They claim that the fruit grants them wisdom and visionary insight, but eventually the fruit's magical properties corrupt their bodies, leading to death.</p>

						<h2>The Glasspool</h2>
						<p>Rainfall comes to Akoum in violent torrents during the winter, and the surface undergoes a brief but glorious transformation in spring. Lakes form overnight in the crystal fields, and water cascades across the rock spires. This beauty is as fleeting as anything else on Akoum- after days or weeks, another tremor drains the water away beneath the surface. The one fixed body of water of any notable size in the region is the Glasspool, a huge, strangely hexagonal, lake with cool, clean water. Its name comes from the complete stillness of its surface at nearly all times. Tremors and eruptions somehow leave the water unmoved. Most sentient creatures avoid the clear water, although amphibious drakes are known to make the lake their home, drawn perhaps to the only reliable source of blue mana in the mountain range.</p>

The Sunken City has not been extensively explored, but it was once an ancient center of learning, home to a repository of magical knowledge.</p>
