							<h1>Guul Draz</h1>
							<p>" Is there anything in Guul Draz that doesn't suck the life out of you?"
								~ Tarsa, Sea Gate sell-sword																
								</p>
						</header>
						<p>Sharing its western border with Bala Ged, Guul Draz is a humid region of twisted, dark-leafed trees, fetid lagoons, and vast, tangled swamps. A sense of decay permeates the place, from the reek of moldering vegetation to the crumbling ruins jutting up from the black waters like broken bones. Venomous spiders and scorpions crawl among the trees, and deadly snakes slither on branches or swim in the stagnant waters. The festering decay and noxious growth that define most of Guul Draz extend from the depths of the earth and high into the air. As on the rest of Zendikar, islands of rock, vegetation, and mud float in the air overhead, often spilling cascades of water from some impossible source. Tangles of roots and raw elemental water are suspended above the swamplands. And gaping sinkholes open into deep caverns with their own stagnant swamps far below.</p>

						<p>Death comes in many forms on Guul Draz, most of them slow, subtle, and agonizing. Vampires embody the ever-present danger, stalking and feeding on members of other races that are foolish enough to come in search of ancient ruins or actually build settlements in the vast swamp. Venomous animals of all kinds lurk in the swamps and gullies, from tiny spiders to enormous six-legged basilisks. Even the terrain - quicksand, hidden sinkholes, carnivorous plants, and toxic pools - can kill as surely here as in the volcanic reaches of Akoum. The sodden land and murky waters alike are treacherous, concealing deadly hazards and hungry predators. At least a monstrous crocodile offers a swift death, in contrast to the lingering torment of a wasting sickness or a giant scorpion's agonizing sting.</p>

						<p>On other continents, vampires usually live in hiding, blending in among the other races as best they can, but in Guul Draz they live openly. They are dangerous, sometimes turning on the merfolk and humans who are bold enough to live in the vampire cities, and sometimes infiltrating and feeding on the scattered villages and tribes of elves, humans, and merfolk that exist across Guul Draz. Despite this, Guul Draz has a significant number of visitors. Although walking among the vampires is extremely risky, the dark swamps also offer the prospect of dark power and great wealth.</p>

						<p>Besides the vampires, merfolk live along the waters of Guul Draz and are an important part of the flow of trade and commerce through the land. An unusually high number of merfolk who secretly follow Cosi's creed dwell here. Humans have also carved out several settlements along the edges of Guul Draz and along its major waterways. Both humans and merfolk make their living on the rivers that are the most reliable highways throughout the region, despite the risks of predators. In addition, small tribes of elves and humans live in the Zof Marsh and the Hanging Swamp, respectively. These tribes are extremely insular and suspicious of visitors, as they believe that all outsiders are deadly bloodsuckers like the vampires that occasionally raid their territory.</p>

				<!-- Malakir Districts -->
				<section class="wrapper style1 align-center" id="traits">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>Districts of Malakir</h2>
						<p>Over a thousand years old, Malakir is the most well-developed settlement on Zendikar – housing over 150,000 residents. Divided into five districts, each is named after the vampire clan that controls it. These clans work together to keep Malakir prosperous overall, but constantly seek to increase their own power at the expense of the others, diminishing the potential for a more widespread vampiric empire.</p>
						<div class="items style4 medium onscroll-fade-in">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-anchor"></span>
								<h3>Nirkana</h3>
								<p>Built directly on the water, this district is known for its mercantile industry, containing Malakir’s vast docks. This district can only be traversed via the canals that wind through its buildings. House Nirkana is uneasily allied with House Ghet to leverage their combined strength against House Kalastria. Nirkana assassins, called Lacerators, have always been notorious for their stealth and skill, and now these assassins fight for Ghet as well.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-wine-glass"></span>
								<h3>Kalastria</h3>
								<p>Located on a cliff overlooking the rest of the city, it is the oldest, wealthiest part of the city and the center of many bureaucratic and diplomatic functions. House Kalastria has long been the wealthiest vampire family, and members consider themselves the aristocracy of Malakir. They often call themselves the Highborn, and they think of themselves as superior to all the other vampires.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-coins"></span>
								<h3>Emevera</h3>
								<p>Built in a low point in the city, bordering the Nirkana district, this region is well protected by giant stone dykes and contains much of the city’s entertainment industry. House Emevera is a wealthy family but not an aristocratic one. Its access to resources enabled it to build the strong stone dikes that keep Malakir from flooding, but the Highborn of House Kalastria have never admitted their Emevera cousins as social equals.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-hammer"></span>
								<h3>Urnaav</h3>
								<p>A mix of stone-paved roads and narrow canals, lying between the low point of Emevera District and the high ground of Kalastria District, this region is home to many of the craftsmen that call Malakir home. House Urnaav claims the distinction of being the largest of the major houses, though it lacks the wealth and prestige to hold much influence in Malakir's politics.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-water"></span>
								<h3>Ghet</h3>
								<p>A flooded and impoverished district on the outskirts of the city, extending from the Emevera District, this region is home to the many desperate hunters who provide the city with food. House Ghet, led by Kalitas, is a brutal and vicious house, constantly at odds with House Kalastria.</p>

						<h2>Bloodchiefs of Malakir</h2>
						<p>The bloodchiefs who rule vampire society are incredibly ancient beings, infected long ago by an eldritch disease. Any given bloodchief has literally forgotten more than most other living beings will ever know, carrying no recollection of his or her own creation. Drana of House Kalastria, though, has begun experimenting with magic to dredge her memories for information with some limited success. The bloodchiefs are the parents of the entire vampire race. Only a bloodchief can pass on the infection that animates their nearly dead bodies. </p>

				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" >
					<div class="content">
						<p>Over the centuries, the number of bloodchiefs has been reduced from hundreds to barely a dozen as the houses warred among themselves. Survivors from a slain bloodchief's house have been incorporated into other houses, so it is not necessarily accurate to say that all members of House Ghet, for example, were transformed by Kalitas, the Ghet bloodchief. Nevertheless, they all owe Kalitas their allegiance and follow his lead in everything. A vampire house consists of the bloodchief, a number of lesser vampires, and each vampire's retinue of nulls - the zombie-like creatures created when a lesser vampire drains the blood of another sentient being. A major house, like the five that rule Malakir, might contain about a thousand vampires, each with a contingent of three to five nulls. Lesser houses might have as few as a hundred vampires.</p>

							<h2>Hagra Swamp</h2>
							<p>"Tribes of ogres make their home in the Hagra ruins. Cruel as vampires, they place no value on life. It's like their lungs are filled with the foul breath of the underworld. I always hire one, though, because they can slaughter undead better than anyone else."

						<h2>Dangers of Hagra Swamp</h2>
						<p>Much of Guul Draz is covered in an enormous mire of murky water called the Hagra Swamp, dotted with clumps of rotting organic matter and the occasional rocky outcropping. Low trees draped with hanging moss jut up from the sodden ground to hide the sky, and rising mist shrouds the surface of the water. Standing pools of water often have a sickly green tint, exposing the foulness they contain. Gloom hangs over the swamp like a dark canopy, which perfectly suits the vampires and other creatures that reside in it. The abundant flora in the Hagra Swamp includes a wide array of deadly plants that derive nutrients from large prey rather than the waterlogged soil. Tendrils from giant carnivorous lilies and algae eagerly latch on to passing creatures, dragging them down into the fetid depths to be consumed. Giant underground caverns have been filled with strange fungal organisms with toxic spores.</p>
						<div class="items style4 medium onscroll-fade-in">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-bolt"></span>
								<h3>Snap Fens</h3>
								<p>Snap fens are low rises that appear to be solid ground surrounded by reeds. But when a creature or vessel pushes into a snap fen, the strong, sharp reeds whip out to their full length, spearing anything nearby and then slowly retract into the water, dragging their prey along. Creatures that survive the initial attack often drown as the reeds hold them underwater. The bodies decaying in the water serve as food for the horrible reeds. Merfolk bandits often lurk around the snap fens, since the reeds are easily avoided below the surface of the water. These bandits lure small barges into range of a snap fen and then scoop up the cargo after the barge is shattered and dragged under.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-water"></span>
								<h3>Greed Lilies</h3>
								<p>Giant water lilies grow in many areas of the swamp, completely covering the water surface with leaves so large, and so densely packed, that travelers can march across them without sinking more than ankle deep. However, lilies of a carnivorous variety called greed lilies grow among stands of their harmless cousins. When a creature stands or walks on a greed lily's pad, the leaf rapidly curls inward, wrapping around its hapless prey. While the thick, waxy leaf holds the creature fast, corrosive fluid seeps out to dissolve its flesh and extract the nutrients that the plant feeds on. Some opportunistic scavengers make a living by gathering metal equipment, unharmed by the corrosive fluid, that accumulates in the muck below a greed lily.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-skull-crossbones"></span>
								<h3>Filth Bursts</h3>
								<p>Scattered around the Hagra Swamp are patches of ground that appear solid but are actually bubbles of noxious gas and organic filth kept from bursting by a thick crust of soil. The slightest damage to this crust, though, releases a massive eruption of oily black sludge called a filth burst. The toxic sludge is usually fatal to whatever creature triggered the burst, but occasionally the corrupted magic it holds actually transforms the creature into a bestial horror.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Hagra Cistern</h2>
						<p>This ancient structure, vast and mysterious, sits at the edge of the great Hagra Swamp - no one can say for sure which gave its name to the other. The theory is that the Hagra Cistern was built in an effort to reclaim land that had been corrupted long ago. If this is true, the effort was only partially successful. The land shifted, creating the Pelakka Karst, and the rivers diverted. But the pipes and drains clogged, and the fresh river water has pooled into an enormous mire of foulness and corruption. The waters of the Hagra Swamp still flow, very slowly, toward the cistern, but instead of being purified there, they carry corruption back out under the swamp. The filth bursts that occur in the Swamp are the result of this water making its way back to the surface. The origin and intended function of the Hagra Cistern are not widely known, and careful study of the cistern has proven difficult thanks to the corrupt and evil forces that seem drawn to it. Ogres hunt the area, led by shamans who view the cistern as a portal to the underworld, supported by the frequent sighting of demons in the area.</p>

						<h2>Pelakka Karst</h2>
						<p>A vast region of limestone gullies, sinkholes, rises, and caves surrounds the Hagra Swamp, crossed by fast-flowing rivers churning through narrow canyons and tunnels. This Pelakka Karst is treacherous to navigate, and the predators lurking in the waterways of the largest river predators in all of Zendikar adding to the danger. In addition, much of the Karst shifts regularly, and some of the caves are actually monstrous mouths. Those who travel down the wrong channel can find themselves ground to a paste by the rapidly moving walls or swallowed by enormous wurms.</p>

						<h2>Lake Jeft & Lulea</h2>
						<p>Rivers that flow southward out of the Pelakka Karst wind their way to Lake Jeft, a large freshwater lake to the southwest. Its dark waters are thick with weeds and algae, but merfolk swim near the shores and up the rivers that feed the lake.</p>
						<p><b>Lulea.</b> A merfolk settlement called Lulea is located on the dark shore of Lake Jeft. The merfolk are mostly concerned with the river and lake trade, policing the major waterways and demanding tolls from anyone who travels over or under the waters. The settled merfolk actively oppose most of their kind who act as river bandits, but a few such bands are recognized as official privateers, chartered to take down the other groups and bring their plunder to Lulea. Many of them follow Cosi, including their leader, a sage named Ennesh. Ennesh has ruled for the last decade, and she is widely regarded as a just, if stern, ruler. The vampires count her as a good neighbor, figuring that the predation of her privateers is substantially less costly than the river and swamp bandits they hunt.</p>

						<h2>Hanging Swamp</h2>
						<p>In the north of Guul Draz, a maze of floating water globules, clots of mud and reeds, and tangled vegetation hangs in the air above and inside an enormous sinkhole, with roots and creepers anchoring the whole soggy mass to the sinkhole's sides. The entire bizarre swamp network is in constant motion: water flows from one location to another, clumps of earth drift to new positions, and vines twist and coil around whatever solid mass happens to be nearby. Only the most expert guides can navigate the swamp with any certainty since the pathways are constantly changing, and many unprepared explorers have entered it and simply never emerged again. The Hanging Swamp is filled with predators that use the terrain to mask their own presence and trap prey. Giant amphibians and insects abound, concealed in the vines and reeds. The deadly Guul Draz python is large enough to swallow a human, and a few small tribes of humans live in crude reed huts on some of the larger clumps of sodden ground.</p>

						<p>The northwest coast of Guul Draz is covered in a huge mangrove swamp called Zof Marsh. The red mangrove trees that grow here are valued for their flowers, which are a source of a powerfully intoxicating pollen that is used to make perfumes, potions, and a deadly poison favored by vampire assassins. Stalking swamp cats, a small clan of Tajuru-nation elves and enormous saltwater crocodiles are prominent denizens of the marsh. An ancient ruin, the Helix of Zof lies in the midst of the swamp, spiraling up among the mangroves from an unknown source buried in the silt at their roots.</p>

Slowly rotating in place, the Helix of Zof is haunted by shades - dark spirits that bear little resemblance to whatever form they had in life.

Likewise, Nimana is the major export center for the mercantile products of Guul Draz that are sent to other lands for trade. As such, nearly every vampire who is heading out to infiltrate the rest of the world passes through Nimana.</p>

						<p>The Chromatic Council is a pretentious order of mages specializing in the pure colors of mana. Although it enjoys some modest fame as a school for mages, the council's more important work is the sponsorship of various expeditions to explore the ruins of Guul Draz. The Chromatic Council has a particular interest in magical treasures and lore, and won’t question the means by which any magical items are brought to them.</p>
