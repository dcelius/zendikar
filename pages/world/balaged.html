							<h1>Bala Ged</h1>
						</header>
						<p>This subcontinent lies a little to the south of Akoum, and is connected to Akoum by underground caves and waterways, unbeknownst to almost all but the beastly Surrakar. On its east, Bala Ged is bordered by Guul Draz, making up the greater Bala Draz continent. This land is covered by thick, humid rainforests resulting in some of the deadliest flora and fauna on the plane. The rare travelers to Bala Ged generally pass through the marsh-like Bojuka Bay, following the Umung River up to the mountains. This unforgiving place is home to territorial Joraga and Mul Daya elves, the barely sentient and notoriously deadly Surrakar, and a collection of humans, elves, and Kor who maintain small villages along the Umung River, guiding travelers on their journey.</p>

							<h2>Guum Wilds</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A dense, humid jungle boasting the largest array of carnivorous and poisonous plants on Zendikar covers much of Bala Ged. The flora of the Guum Wilds rivals the titanic juworrel and jaddi trees of Murasa, wrapping around every surface in a continuous, tentacular crawl.</p>
						<p><b>Riverroot.</b> A small village located high in the trees within the Guum Wilds, this place is home to the Mul Daya elves known for their potent magics that are rumored to be occult in nature.</p>

						<h2>Surrakar Caves</h2>
						<p>Deep in the Guum Wilds lay a series of limestone outcroppings and hillocks that serve as the primary habitat for the vicious Surrakar. There is a vast tunnel system rumored to be underneath this portion of the Guum Wilds, but exploration is next to impossible due to the extreme territorial behavior of the Surrakar. Despite the cavernous nature, this region is primarily covered in thick algae and marsh.</p>

				<!-- Bay -->

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Bojuka Bay</h2>
						<p>This swampy inlet lay at the edge of the Guum Wilds, protected from the waves by the thousands of trees between it and the ocean. Initially an inlet, the prolific flora of the Guum Wilds has overtaken the water creating a vast swampy region. Fed by the Umung River and several waterfalls that cascade down the surrounding cliffs, Bojuka Bay is a watery marsh of vast proportions. The Umung River flows slowly through the bay but provides a clear and deep passage for boats going to or coming from the Guum Wilds. Those who pass through Bojuka Bay have to be prepared to bribe or fend off the savage marsh trolls that live there. Fortunately, the Grotag tribe of goblins that live in the trees can provide assistance in this regard, assuming they too were appropriately bribed or intimidated.</p>

						<h2>Umung River</h2>
						<p>One of the only safe ways to traverse the Guum Wilds is along the Umung River. Descending in steps from the interior to sea level as it winds through Bala Ged, once explorers pass the dangers of Bojuka Bay, reaching the interior of Bala Ged by way of the Umung River is a matter of slow progress against the current and portaging small vessels around or pulling them up the many rapids and falls at each step. Small villages of humans along the Umung can usually be relied on to aid travelers at such points. After passing through the dangerous Bojuka Bay, there are dotted settlements of humans, kor, and elves created to help travelers get past the various rapids and waterfalls. Each waterfall takes explorers even deeper into the heart of Bala Ged.</p>

						<h2>Umungshore</h2>
						<p>Located along the shores of the Umung river, near its source in the mountains, Umungshore is the largest colony of Merfolk in Bala Ged. Generally accepted as the terminus for most expeditions into Bala Ged, it’s known for its stark mountainous beauty and astronomical research. Its proximity to the Pass of Emrika means Umungshore also is a waypoint along the few trade routes passing between Bala Ged and Guul Draz.</p>

							<h2>Blackstone Peaks</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Under seemingly perpetual darkness, these jagged basalt peaks split the greater continent of Bala Draz into its two parts. When possible, most travelers would rather return to the coast of Bala Ged and sail all the way around to Guul Draz rather than taking any of the mountain passes due to the haunted reputation of the peaks, the violent border disputes between the elves of Bala Ged and the vampires of Guul Draz, and the aggressive clans of goblins and raiders that stalk the dark cliffs.</p>

							<h2>Pass of Emrika</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This shadowy pass crosses through the Blackstone Peaks, connecting Bala Ged and Guul Draz along its interior. Other passes between the mountain range exist, but they are not as well known or maintained, meaning the Pass of Emrika is the primary source of transit between the two subcontinents - even though it’s still incredibly dangerous.</p>

				<!-- Vales -->

						<h2>The Tangled Vales</h2>
						<p>The Tangled Vales are interconnected jungle valleys that run between steep hills, rippling across the southern portion of Bala Ged. Clans of Joraga elves make their homes in the vales in uneasy coexistence with some human hunters and trappers. The jungles of the vales are a twisted and dangerous morass ot predatory plants infested with bestial threats, but the Joraga make relatively safe zones by cultivating patches of deadly, nettled vines called bloodbriars as a defensive barrier around their paths and villages. Even the elves avoided the fungus-choked hilltops of the vales, knowing them to be even more deadly - the high points of the land are exposed to unpredictable winds and deadly flying hunters, such as the ominous, floating gomazoa.</p>
