							<p>"If you find yourself in Sejiri, know that you cannot be dead. Even the gods wouldnâ€™t be that cruel."
								~ Zendikari saying

						<p class="major">A desolate and unexplored land, filled only with howling winds and bitter cold. An arctic expanse of elevated polar landscape, Sejiri is the least populated and most remote of Zendikar's regions. Soaring cliffs are topped by a rugged, mountainous plateau of snow, ice, and tundra. Its freezing wastes confront travelers with gales of howling wind and stinging sleet, brittle ice bridges over rapidly-flowing rivers, frost-breathing predators, and enormous, floating stone bowls that spill avalanches of ice and snow across the landscape.</p>

						<p>Expeditions have explored this region, but almost no permanent settlements exist. Without shelter from the harsh elements, structures built by the humans, merfolk, and kor of the area are quickly destroyed by the exposure to the harsh elements or by the marauding ice elementals themselves, keeping the humanoid population low. In the thawing season, lichens and scrubby grasses appeared in patchy meadows across Sejiri. These resilient plants provide just enough sustenance to support its population of shaggy, velvet-antlered deer, which in turn feed Sejiri's population of drakes, wolves, yeti, and snow rocs.</p>

						<p>Despite the dangers, rugged Sejiri supports a handful of staunch explorers. Human and kor explorers bred a hardy line of gray-white wolves to pull their sleds across the snow. The kor have mapped a substantial portion of Sejiri, but the winds and ice storms of the region tend to wipe out known landmarks after months or weeks, rendering most of their maps historical oddities rather than valuable guides. Some kor believe that the ice shelves of Sejiri actually move in regular patterns and that their maps in fact point to a feasible model of the spiritual forces that lie beneath the tundra.</p>

						<h2>Ikiral</h2>
						<p>Outposts in Sejiri are few and far between, but in the ruins of an enormous stone hedron huddles the settlement and trading post called Ikiral. The hedron lay awkwardly on its side, partly sunken into the icy tundra, and split down the middle. In the crevice, partly sheltered from the elements, clusters the wind-scoured stone buildings of Ikiral. Frequented by wolf sledders, tundra scholars, and thrill-seekers, the outpost is the best place to find supplies, rumors, and an up-to-date map of the surrounding area.</p>

						<h2>Benthidrix</h2>
						<p>An ancient underwater shrine lying under one of Sejiri's deep riverbeds. Called Benthidrix, it was originally built by a lost culture of arctic merfolk who dwelled there long ago. On the one hand, such a place promises a fantastic wealth of knowledge about an otherwise forgotten era of Zendikar's history. On the other, it is extraordinarily isolated, so exploring it is hardly a priority while there are more accessible ruins to be explored.</p>

								<h3>Sejiri Skyclave</h3>
