							<h1>Tazeem</h1>
							<p>"Never look too deep, where the waters turn dark. What the sea has hidden there may not stay down forever." 
								~ Thada Adel, merfolk acquisitor								
								</p>
						</header>
						<p>This temperate continent to the southwest of Akoum possesses some of the greatest unknown wonders of Zendikar. Wide rivers originating from bubbling springs and huge, mist-cloaked lakes meander through Tazeem's verdant plains and teeming forests. Rushing waters plunge through narrow canyons and cascade down towering cliffs into the sea. Dismal swamps trap the waters that can't find their way to the sea. Peninsulas jut out into the sea, and narrow land bridges arc over rivers and bisect great lakes. And the largest city on the continent, Sea Gate, is built not on dry land, but on an ancient dam that divides the inland sea of Halimar from the ocean beyond.</p>

						<p>From the Halimar, a gigantic inland sea held back by an ancient wall over 500 feet tall, to Emeria, the Sky Ruin, a massive collection of floating hedrons and shattered earth, Tazeem sees more adventurers than anywhere else on the plane. As such, the legendary Expeditionary Houses are based out of Sea Gate. Tazeem’s proximity to the other continents and fairly temperate nature has led to Sea Gate becoming the center of all trade in Zendikar. Just like much of Zendikar however, Tazeem houses its dangers. Leviathans are rumored to stalk the depths of the Halimar. Giant spiders and prehistoric beasts lurk in the tangled, moss-covered trees of Oran-Rief forest. And recently, there have been reports from the heights of Emeria of unspeakable horrors haunting any who dare come too close.</p>

						<h2>Sea Gate</h2>
						<p>The town of Sea Gate is built atop the great stone dam that forms Halimar, Tazeem's inland sea. A cylindrical tower of white stone - the Lighthouse - rises high above the dam, and buildings of stone, brick, and wood are built all across its wide, flat surface. The largest settlement on Tazeem, Sea Gate, has a strong, well trained militia organized to protect the town against raiders and aerial attacks (from drakes, thunder eels, and so on), as well as to maintain law and order. Sea Gate is also the largest center of commerce and culture on Zendikar. This city houses nearly 100,000 residents, many of which are traders, craftsmen, and dockworkers. Almost every race in Zendikar can be found in numbers here, but the majority of residents are humans.</p>

						<h2>The Lighthouse</h2>
						<p>A 20-story white-stone cylindrical tower that rises an additional 350 feet above the seawall's eastern edge. More than just a beacon, the Lighthouse is the center of all learning in Tazeem. It is a nexus for merfolk explorers and chroniclers, boasting thousands of leather scrolls filled with maps, spells, descriptions of archeological finds, lists of plant and animal classifications, and theoretical discussions of the Roil. This is all thanks to the combined work of the Sea Gate Expeditionary Houses, who donate to the Lighthouse on a regular basis, and in return the Lighthouse funds more expeditions for the Houses. The Lighthouse, tended by merfolk mages, has always kept a blue flame lit to guide ships into port. Given that this light has never gone out in the entire history of Sea Gate, it has become a symbol of a unified Zendikar, providing hope to all who doubt the future.</p>

						<h2>Sea Gate Expeditionary Houses</h2>
						<p>Named after the continents that they tend to focus their efforts on, these houses are collections of former adventurers, researchers, scholars, tradesmen, and other interested parties who fund expeditions to parts unknown. Each house has an ancillary outpost in the continent they are named after, but all of the houses originated and are based in Tazeem as it is the center of trade on the plane. The houses cooperate, and sometimes work together, on the more dangerous excursions, but generally, each house keeps to themselves in order to drive up the resulting fame, profits, and glory that a successful expedition returns. Sejiri is the only continent that lacks an expeditionary house, as it has been seen as a waste to focus effort there when there are so many other places to explore on Zendikar. However, the Tazeem House, being the most successful, has been known to send small and especially capable groups to the icy wastes on rare occasions. Almost no adventurer works without the backing of one of these houses.</p>

						<p>A huge hedron floating in the air near Sea Gate. The wealthy of the city live within, owning lavish mansions carved from the ancient stone. The only way to access the Sky Rock is by flying beast, and with the Sky Rock possessing its own Griffon-mounted military defense force, any unauthorized attempts to access this island in the sky usually results in the trespasser being granted a formal invitation to visit the ocean, nearly a thousand feet below.</p>

				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" >
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Halimar</h2>
						<p>Originally a bay, Halimar is surrounded on three sides by the rocky cliffs of the island. But the mouth of the bay was closed off by an ancient dam of incredible width and strength. The dam towers high above the level of the ocean on its outer side, while the Halimar laps at the top edge of the dam's inner side. The dam and the town built on its surface are collectively known as Sea Gate. Halimar has been separate from the outer sea long enough that it has its own unique species of brightly colored fish, tusked seals, and massive leviathans that dwell in the depths. No one knows when the seawall was built, but due to these primordial fish not seen elsewhere on Zendikar, many scholars believe that Halimar, and therefore the seawall, must be truly ancient. When Halimar is placid, the water is a sparkling cerulean. But the Roil moving across the water creates white-capped waves and treacherous whirlpools. Tidal waves crash against Sea Gate and the cliffs. Despite the tumultuous seas and plethora of carnivorous sea creatures, sailing the Halimar is the safest way from Sea Gate to the mouth of the Umara River Gorge, so maritime trade thrives on Halimar, and ships carry explorers and other travelers across the Inland Sea on a regular basis. Followers of the merfolk water god Ula believed he swam endlessly through the Halimar, flanked by two massive leviathans known as Ula's Guardians.</p>

						<h2>Halimar Depths</h2>
						<p>The building of the Sea Gate dam raised the water level of the inland sea, drowning some structures that had previously been on dry land. Some of these ancient sites, lying in the relatively shallow depths near the shores of Halimar, have been thoroughly explored, but others have been buried in silt or swallowed in the earth through the activity of the Roil. Hedrons fallen from the Sky Realm also lie all across Halimar's floor, potentially holding undiscovered magical secrets.</p>

						<p>At the end of the Halimar, two gigantic statues carved from the cliffs flank the entrance to the Umara River Gorge. These two stone behemoths were created by merfolk masons over nearly a century of toil to represent the mythical guardians that supposedly swam with Ula across the Halimar. It's considered very bad luck to make eye contact with the statues while passing under their gaze, and all captains worth their salt will bow their heads in both reverence and fear when in their shadow.</p>

						<h2>Umara River</h2>
						<p>A great rushing river that flows from its source at the Halimar through the deep Umara River Gorge that bisects the continent. It drops over 800 feet over a series of waterfalls, most famously the 300-foot Magosi Waterfall. Although the river is mostly white water, the river and its gorge are relatively stable, resisting the effects of the Roil, so many settlements of humans, merfolk, and elves cluster in the relative safety of the rocky canyon. Winds matching the speed of the river sweep along the gorge, and the merfolk use gliders to drift down the gorge. These gliders aren't fast and can't carry cargo, but they are an easier way to travel downstream than taking a boat over the river and across the many portages around waterfalls.</p>

						<p>Plunging almost 300 feet over a sheer cliff, Magosi is the tallest waterfall along the river. The portage near the top of the waterfall is a popular resting point for travelers, including both nomads and adventurers. Some number of traders and other explorers are always camped at the portage. This the best place outside of Sea Gate to trade for pathway stones, supplies, and minor magic. That said, it is hardly a safe refuge. Sphinxes and drakes seem drawn to the falls, and make their homes on the walls of the gorge nearby.</p>

						<p>A popular resting point for nomadic groups. As all travelers down the gorge must pass through the portage, it is the inner continent's most popular market for pathway stones, supplies, and merfolk spell scrolls. Nonetheless, it is still a dangerous spot to camp, as travelers routinely disappear in the night, their bodies never found.</p>

						<p>Made from enormous conch shells, sea stone, and coral held together by vines, moss, and a complex network of nets and lines, these interconnected islands float high above the Umara River, anchored to the ground and the sides of the Gorge by vines thick enough to be traversed like roads. The merfolk enclave within is a hive-like structure consisting of bathing halls, corridors, and sleeping chambers. It is the largest merfolk settlement on Zendikar housing around 20,000 merfolk within the Helm and on the riverbanks below it. Around another 15,000 residents of varying races share this land with the merfolk, with the number decreasing in winter and early spring due to the dangers of ice and snowmelt in the Gorge preventing pilgrims and traders from visiting. The merfolk rely on goods brought by human traders and elves from the inland forests, and the beauty of this enclave draws merfolk here from across the plane.</p>

The original merfolk capital, situated on an island in the middle of the Umara River directly below Coralhelm, is an elaborate structure of pale stone flecked with sparkling crystals, a masterpiece of architecture and the pinnacle of merfolk civilization - before the completion of Coralhelm. The former capital still shines in the sunlight for a short period each day, when the shadows of the conch shells overhead pass, but the sun hasn’t fully set. For that fleeting moment, the river and the old capital sparkle like stars beneath the incredible structure hanging overhead.</p>

							<h2>Wren Grotto</h2>
							<p>"I grew up in the cliff-caves of Wren Grotto, the most beautiful location in all of Zendikar. This is the training ground of the giant falcons, and we paint the temples gold to honor them. In the wild, their nests are woven from the strands of treasure only they know how to find. "
								 ~ Ilori, merfolk falconer
								</p>
						</header>
						<p>Wren Grotto is an area of the Umara River Gorge near Coralhelm where small caves open into the cliff walls over a series of natural rock outcroppings and platforms. Merfolk mystics (formerly identified with the Emeria creed) have constructed elaborate gilded facades leading into the cliff walls, where they have expanded natural caves into comfortable homes. An elite group of merfolk live in the grotto, where they train giant falcons for riding. These mounts are used primarily for exploration, with the trainers coaxing the falcons ever higher through Emeria's Realm in hopes of reaching the highest layers.</p>

						<h2>Oran-Rief Forest</h2>
						<p>Much of the interior of Tazeem is covered in a thick network of giant trees, with wild branches forming an enormous lattice across the island known as the Oran-Rief forest. Shrubs, vines, honeysuckle, ferns, grasscs, and tangles of blackberry thrive beneath the tree branches. Because the dense canopy blocks much of the sunlight, the ground vegetation grows explosively fast in places where the sun does manage to shine through. Known as Emeria’s Blessing, this explosive growth is both beautiful and dangerous vines and brambles can grow so quickly that animals and explorers can become caught and suffocated in the growth. In part because of the danger of this blessing, many of the creatures that live in the Oran-Rief are enormous, contributing to the forest's nickname, the Vastwood. Hydras, wurms, oversized spiders, and ravenous dinosaurs are among the animals that crash through the heavy growth, sometimes eating away the ground cover and sometimes breaking away canopy branches and letting sunlight reach the ground.</p>

						<p>These beaches that round the perimeter of Tazeem and flank both sides of the Halimar sea wall consist of crunchy, white sand made of calcite crystals. They are stable enough in some places, but in others the calcite is a thin layer over soft mud or water-saturated sand that quickly swallows any creature that breaks through the outer crust. The calcite spreads in wide flats between the churning waves and the rise of the Bulwark and Halimar cliffs just inland. Scattered throughout the flats, like foothills before the sharp rise of the cliffs and mountains, are looming rock formations shaped by the ocean tides.</p>

						<p>These outcroppings are large enough to provide solid campsites for groups of nomads moving across the treacherous beaches, and the abundant crevices and pockets in their surfaces provide an environment where life can flourish. Trees sink their roots into the rock, giving shelter to small animals such as turtles, small primates, large sloths, and numerous flying species - drakes, herons, owls, and giant falcons. Thus, the rocks are islands of green vegetation and life in the otherwise barren sandy flats. The hedrons that drift in the sky above most of Tazeem do not extend above onto the Calcite Flats, and the flats are unaffected by the Roil. Once in a while, though, a hedron tumbles past this edge and plummets to the ground, lodging in the sand. The nomads of the flats break these hedrons into small pieces and sell them as pathway stones to guide explorers or as materials to use in making lithomantic weapons.</p>

							Gate and the settlements along the Umara River. The word "dojir" is a merfolk term used to describe heretics who are cast out of the community, but the humans of Tazeem, including the nomads
							themselves, have appropriated it to refer to these traveling bands.
							The Dojir hunt herd animals or fish the coastal waters for food, and they barter for other supplies in Hadatown, Bogden, or with other bands. They collect hedron shards and trade them as pathway stones, scavenge flotsam and jetsam on the shores, and gather rare and valuable herbs from the outcropping forests in the flats. They also sometimes sneak into settlements along the Umara River and steal the goods they need.

No outcroppings provide solid ground anywhere near this site, and the ground is particularly unstable around it, so the Dojir nomads avoid it. A few travelers have found it, though, and with returned tales of the legendary Sunspring. It's a white marble fountain, fed by an underwater spring, whose pure waters glow with a soft, greenish light. A great stone eagle, crusted with old moss, crowns the fountain, with the water spilling around its feet. The waters of the Sunspring hold powerful healing magic that can banish poison and disease, close even mortal wounds, wash away fatigue, and provide a glimmer of hope for those even in the deepest pits of despair and desperation.</p>

They also study and experiment with hedrons that have tumbled from Emeria. The largest such outpost is the Tikal Harborage, half-submerged in a pool on the Calcite Flats northeast from Sea Gate. With the help of the kor, the merfolk anchored and pulled down a few of the largest hedrons from Emeria, which merfolk mages use to create a relatively safe refuge and power the spells wielded to capture the leviathans.

Some of these pit caves have reservoirs of freshwater at the bottom, so resourceful travelers have installed pulley systems to bring the water to the surface. Others are filled with a choking mist that leaks into the air above, poisoning anything that ventures too close to the mouth of the shaft. The most dangerous pit caves look totally innocuous, but geysers at the bottom occasionally blast boiling water into the air.</p>

The nomads of the Calcite Flats and the raiders of the Bulwark visit Hadatown frequently - the nomads to trade pathway stones for basic supplies, the raiders to secure weapons and armor.

							<h2>Emeria, the Sky Realm</h2>
							<p>"You might find a way into the Sky Ruin, but you'll find its secrets well protected by shifting hedrons and Roil winds." 
								~ Maizah Shere, Tazeem lullmage
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>The sky above Tazeem is covered in a blanket of hedrons floating high overhead. Since the merfolk believe this was once the home of Emeria, the goddess of the sky, the merfolk place great religious significance on this hedron field. Merfolk myth posits that Emeria’s sky-castle was destroyed in a cataclysmic upheaval, and the shattered remnants remain suspended in the heavens, high above the lower rubble fields, holding onto some semblance of the goddess’ power. Many of Tazeem’s expeditions come here to discover both treasure and the true power of the hedrons.</p>

						<h2>Pathway Stones</h2>
						<p>The massive hedrons are covered in runes and retain magical properties even when they fall from the sky or are broken into shards. Pathway stones always point to the direct center of the hedron field, no matter where in Tazeem they are taken. Those who understand how to orient themselves according to the hedron field can use the pathway stones for navigation. These pathway stones are usually sold in palm-sized chunks, and are painstakingly chipped off the hedrons by cutter-traders. Most of these merchants are merfolk who scour the surface of Tazeem for fallen stones, but they cannot meet the high demand for pathway stones. Thus, brave adventurers risk falling, being crushed by colliding hedron pieces, or succumbing to other, more mysterious hazards by climbing into the heights of Emeria's Realm to scavenge pathway stones from hedrons that still float in the sky.</p>

						<h2>Emeria, the Sky Ruin</h2>
						<p>Many of Tazeem's expeditions travel upward, not downward, into ancient ruins. Explorers might scale a tall cliff or mountain and use harpoon lines to climb into the hedron field. The bravest explorers use skyhooks to climb to the higher levels, and some even set up camps on the larger hedron faces. The lowest level of the hedron field is made up of mostly intact, enormous hedron stones, ranging from fifty to one hundred feet long. Some smaller hedrons and broken shards litter the field as well, and these are prized by explorers who sell them as pathway stones. Above this level, not visible from the ground, is a field of rubble, broken pieces of worked stone, shattered hedrons, and chunks of earth. Some structure clearly did once float here, whether or not it was the palace of a sky god is still being debated. No one has navigated above the rubble-filled second layer to reach the realm above, where the merfolk believe that parts of Emeria's castle remain intact. According to reports, this is partly because the passage is so treacherous and partly because the angel lona, called the Shield of Emeria, prevents explorers from climbing higher.</p>
