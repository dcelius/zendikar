							<h1>Ondu</h1>
							<p>"The crossing demands singular focus. Your life consists of these ropes, these hooks, and these rocky crags. Your past is miles below." 
								~ Javad Nasrin, Ondu relic hunter

						<p>Ondu is a vast plateau formed of jagged cliffs rising sharply from tumultuous seas. Wide mesas and plateaus top the high cliff walls, rivers rage through narrow-walled canyons, and cave mouths open into cathedral-like caverns with high, vaulted ceilings. Fierce winds sweep across this high ground and roar through the canyons.</p>

						<p>Travel in Ondu often seems a matter of going up or down as much as moving east or west. The precarious Makindi Trenches, the sky-raking trees of Turntimber, and the abyssal Soul-Mad Stair define the dizzying heights and depths of Ondu. Great bergs of striated rock drift in the sky above even its most level plains, offering whole new worlds of exploration for the kor and their kite sails or explorers who have tamed drakes or griffins as mounts. The land is wild and sparsely settled, with its most populated areas located off the mainland.</p>

						<p>The Ondu mainland is littered with nameless ruins worn to gravel by the raging winds and churning rivers of the Makindi Trenches or overgrown with the flora of the Turntimber. Most of these ruins date to ancient civilizations of kor and elves. The Onduan islands, though, hold more significant sites. Three major islands stand off the coast of Ondu: the large, northernmost island of Agadeem, the Warped Isle; the smaller, temperate Beyeen, Talib’s Brow; and tiny, sea-swept Jwar, the Isle of Secrets. More than any other continent on Zendikar, Ondu seems <em>alive.</em></p>

							<h2>The Makindi Trenches</h2>
							<p>“We count the cliff strata as we soar, their layers marking time like the rings of trees, history laid out by altitude. Ondu's journey has been like our own, stretching beyond its lowly beginnings, striving to kiss the clouds. When we need guidance we aim our kitesails straight down, plunging into the shadowed Trenches, the years dashing by the tips of our canvas wings-and we pull up just before the bottom, surrounded by the oldest of times, whose stony memories enrich our perception."

						<p>The Ondu mainland is crisscrossed by a maze of high-walled canyons called the Makindi Trenches. The canyon walls tower hundreds of feet over white-water rivers or bare rock channels. Mana-fueled winds howl through the canyons at odd intervals, making it essential for climbers and builders to attach their instruments carefully to the cliff walls. Travelers usually make their way along the cliffs edges on wagon trails, but those who are willing to accept great risk in exchange for great speed opt to ride the fast-moving rivers. The walls of the canyons support a surprising range of life. Birds, reptiles, and insects of all sorts nest on the trenches' sheer surfaces. Goblins and kor build into, on, or between canyon walls. Deformed trench giants scale the walls looking for crunchy animals to eat, and enormous spiders spin their webs in the overhangs to snare fliers and climbers.</p>

						<h2>Teetering Peaks</h2>
						<p>Throughout the canyons and plateaus of Makindi, huge boulders perch in precarious, gravity-defying positions atop slender rock spires. Though they have nor been seen to move, these formations are called the Teetering Peaks. Historical changes in Zendikar's fickle gravity may have caused these rocks to shift into their current positions, but some believe that they are deliberate traps set to lure - and then crush - curious passersby. Some mages study the areas around the Teetering Peaks, speculating that their locations form a pattern or map that could have deeper significance to the region.</p>

						<p>Using their lines and hooks as extensions of their limbs, the kor are as comfortable in the vertiginous verticals of Ondu as other races are on flat land. Large numbers of kor live on the mesas and canyon walls in temporary shelters that cling to the cliff faces and hang between the canyon walls on a network of anchor lines and pulley devices. The kor use the name "Cliffhaven" to refer to any shelter in the Makindi Trenches, which has led to the mistaken belief among members of other races that there is a single place by that name. Of course, the kor are constantly on the move, hanging temporary structures as they go. These havens serve as base camps for many explorers of all races.</p>

						<p>Scattered throughout the Makindi Trenches, small goblin warrens are dug into exposed rock faces and offer little protection against flying or climbing intruders. Theoretically, the individual families living in these caves are united into a single tribe, but in practice they compete with each other for food and other resources more than they cooperate. They unite only when threatened by a common enemy - often the kor.</p>

						<p>Some goblin communities in Makindi gravitate toward small, tight fissures between boulders and converging crag spaces that offer better protection against the dangers of the trenches. These "fissure goblins” have an uncanny affinity for the geology of the region; some of their warriors are hired as climbing guides, and some of their shamans are consulted as oracles of earthquakes and gravity shifts.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>The Prison of Omnath</h2>
						<p>Of the legendary places of Ondu, none is surrounded by more controversy than the Prison of Omnath. Omnath is believed to be a divine manifestation of Zendikar's chaotic, primeval mana. Some scholars point to old creation myths suggesting that the gods themselves were created by another being, which could be identified as Omnath. Some call Omnath the "flickering heart," the origin of the primal mana that pulses throughout Zendikar. Despite the uncertainty of Omnath's nature and even existence, a real site in Ondu has been dubbed the Prison of Omnath. At the top of a soaring mesa, through the dense forest that crowns it, and into a murky mire at the grove's heart where shadows move and twist, a binding circle surrounds the entrance to Omnath's prison. A complex arrangement of strange globular swamp growths, stone hedrons, floating clemental flames, and animal bones, the circle creates an uneasy sensation in those who approach it. The effect deters most living beings from approaching the circle's center, where an unfathomable pit gapes in the ground. Destructive surges of power lash out from the circle from time to time, often striking dead those who came too close.</p>

						<p>Despite the danger, pilgrims travel from across Zendikar to visit the Prison of Omnath. Twice a year, they gather to perform the Ritual of Lights, which they believe will keep Omnath contained in the prison. In their view, Omnath is a malevolent force, and its release will bring about the destruction of most forms of life. In their rites, they encircle the site with seventy-seven candles and chant prayers and songs, with the belief that they are strengthening the magical bonds that made up the prison.</p>

It supposedly connects the relatively rational surface world with the seething, surreal void below, where Omnath is bound in incomprehensible chains. Explorers visit the site in order to plumb the depths of the Soul Stair and to try to uncover the mystery behind Omnath's imprisonment, and find long treasures in the deep dark.</p>

						<h2>Turntimber, the Serpentine Forest</h2>
						<p>Only wild and brave creatures reside in Turntimber, a vast temperate forest on the Ondu mainland. Turntimber's famous corkscrew-like trees twist into staggering heights, tracing lazy circles in the sky and inspiring the woodland's name. Over decades and centuries, the trees bend and twist around invisible spikes of mana like a climbing vine around a pole. The mana feeds and strengthens the trees, pushing them to ever greater heights. However, the mana spikes provide no physical support, so the trees' overburdened root structures creak constantly as the trunks sway in the wind. This creaking has inspired stories of a secret language known only to the trees. Many human shamans and druids have ventured into Turnimber in hopes of deciphering this sacred language, believing it to hold the key to the deep wisdom and lore of the forest.</p>

Territorial baloths in search of prey have been known to leap from one tree to another with surprising nimbleness, and their jaws can slice through bone. However, the dominant fauna in Turntimber is the snake, which fills predator roles at all levels. From tiny tree snakes to giant cobras, from the harmless to the lethally venomous, from the mundane to the mana-infused, serpents writhe and hunt throughout the woodland. Some elves believe the snake's shape to be a symbol of mana itself and track their movements to detect patterns in mana flow.</p>

Explorers venture out from Graypelt into Turntimber to seek nodes of mana to harvest from the ancient, creaking trees, for they have developed a way to temporarily "tame" and store small, stable quantities of primal mana. These parcels of mana are very valuable and are attracting the interest of powerful expeditionary outfits.</p>

Savanna covers the island surface, broken up by canyons that are similar to the Makindi Trenches, though not as deep or as numerous. The land is littered with ancient stone hedrons, ranging in size from a few inches to a dozen yards. Many of them are partially or entirely buried in the sodden earth, but recently, a number have risen from the ground and started spinning in unpredictable formations. Sometimes they drift together and form into starlike configurations before drifting apart again. Likely related to the hedrons are the stories from visitors to the island claiming to witness a vision of three immense masks floating in the sky.</p>

						<h2>The Hedron Fields</h2>
						<p>So many hedrons gathered in one place have a marked effect. The laws of nature warp strangely around the Agadeem hedron fields, causing bizarre and unpredictable thaumaturgical and gravitational phenomena. In a distortion of the Roil, huge discs of earth thrust up from the ground, rotate in place, and settle down again at odd angles. Humid winds gather in knotted eddies, forming spheres of elemental air that encase groups of floating hedrons and trap flying creatures. Scholars speculate that the power of the hedron fields, if properly harnessed, could be great enough to accomplish almost unimaginable feats of spellcraft, but the erratic conduct of the hedrons makes it too dangerous for large-scale experimentation.</p>

The influence of the hedrons is clear in the architecture of the settlement, which mimics and incorporates their shapes and the glyphs that cover them. A human religious sect has risen to great prominence in Kabira recently. The sect's evangels, as they call themselves, preach that the Roil is the angels' punishment for the sins of the mortal races. Thus, they offer some dark form of hope by promising that true repentance can bring deliverance from the dangers of the Roil. The repentance they demand involves utter self-abasement, as well as refraining from any trespass into ancient ruins, which they believe are sacred to the angels.</p>

Archaeologists have concluded that the lock opens only on rare occasions during the death hour just before dawn, and only when certain incantations are spoken. However, certain mad human, goblin, and vampire mages, calling themselves "witch vessels," have bypassed the lock and traveled down through the miles and miles of shelf-lined crypt tunnels behind it. These tunnels are filled with deadly traps, which have added countless explorers' corpses to the ones originally interred in the crypt. There, the mages have spoken in a lost "ghost tongue" with the thousands of dead bodies or the spirits that once inhabited them. These mages claim that their communion has granted them knowledge of events - spewing prophecies of doom.</p>

This volcano is believed by many to house the heart of Zendikar, the fiery elemental god Valakut. There are yearly pilgrimages to climb the extremely treacherous black cliffs of the mountain and cast offerings into the roiling volcanic caldera. These pilgrims usually arm themselves with magical wards and protective alchemical concoctions to survive the incredible heat pouring off the mountain along with the other dangers, but about a quarter of all pilgrims still perish during this journey.</p>

						<p>Near the western coast of the isle of Beyeen is a group of enormous tide pools that stair-step down the mountainous slope toward the sea. These pools combine seawater with geothermally heated hot springs, creating basins that seethe with steam. The tide pools are said to be a favorite location for dragons, who use boiling water to cleanse their scales. Some of the pools are cooled by a freshwater stream, making Boilbasin an increasingly popular excursion site for adventurers seeking a risk, and pilgrims making their way up to the peak of Mount Valakut.</p>

The phenomenon originates from a deep, seawater-filled pit on the island and attracts flying creatures such as drakes and even dragons. Some kor tribes call it the Strand, hypothesizing that it is the spiritual thread that connected Zendikar to the afterlife, but some merfolk revile its magic and consider it bad luck, even prohibiting their race from looking upon the light. No explorer has yet uncovered the true function of the light.</p>

						<h2>The Serpent's Maw</h2>
						<p>The stormy waters surrounding Jwar Isle, this region is filled with shallow reefs, exposed ruins, and broken ships. Whenever captains can, they sail around. It is well known that to enter the Serpent’s Maw unprepared is akin to signing one’s own death sentence. Very few ships to enter this region ever make it out, but oddly there are reportedly only a few broken ships within these waters - with some stories claiming that sometimes ships sail out of the Maw without a crew, drifting off into the dark seas, abandoned.</p>
						<p><b>The Ondu Skyclave.</b> Scattered across the Serpent’s Maw and the shores of Jwar Isle, an ancient fortress ruin lies half sunken beneath the crashing waves.</p>

						<h2>Nomads of the Silundi Sea</h2>
						<p>A modest band of humans and merfolk lives on and in the water along the Ondu coasts. Their wooden boats serve as both transport and shelter, though the merfolk spend as much time under the water as on their boats. They subsist on fish and seaweeds gathered by divers, crabs trapped and hunted on the shores, and whatever they can trade in Kabira or Zulaport. Shoal serpents, drakes, and krakens drive these nomads to the brink of extinction.</p>
